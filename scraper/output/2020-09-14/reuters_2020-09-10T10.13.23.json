REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to reduce imports to boost local manufacturing to make India more self-sufficient and enable it to play a bigger role in the global supply chain. That said, the move is seen mainly aimed at slashing the amount of lower-quality imports from China.\n\n\u201cThere is short term pain but there is long term gain,\u201d Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told an auto convention last week, saying India has become a dumping ground for low-quality goods by not having standards similar to other countries.\n\nNew rules mandating stricter quality checks have been flagged in stages for various auto parts since early this year and tighter regulations for wheel rims could be introduced as soon as October, according to a draft government notice.\n\nAll automakers will have to comply, but foreign premium brands such as Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz, BMW BMWG.DE and Audi NSUG.DE will suffer most as they have the highest ratio of imported parts, four auto executives told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an additional compliance burden and will not lead to higher local production because the volumes for luxury are too small to achieve economies of scale,\u201d said one of the executives.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified, citing sensitive negotiations with the government.\n\nSHORT TIMELINES\n\nLuxury carmakers account for less than 1% of India\u2019s annual passenger car sales in terms of volume although they contribute roughly 10% in terms of revenue.\n\nExecutives from premium German brands as well as Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Ford Motor Co F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have held several rounds of talks with government officials in recent weeks, sources said.\n\nMartin Schwenk, head of Mercedes-Benz India, said in a statement to Reuters that additional requirements \u201cwill make low volume business unviable\u201d. His company is requesting a \u201creasonable time line for mid to long term implementation, and exemptions for low volume manufacturers in the short-term.\u201d\n\nVolkswagen Group\u2019s India unit also said in a statement that for premium vehicles it was not possible to localise a \u201cmajority of components or spares as the total size of market is marginal\u201d.\n\nToyota\u2019s India unit is working to meet the rules but the timelines are too short, a spokesperson said.\n\nIt also wants an exemption for limited, direct car imports which the company says are typically made to test new models and technologies in the market before deciding whether to manufacture them locally.\n\nOther automakers named in this article did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nAutomakers are also lobbying through the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) which sources say is seeking up to a year to comply with the rules for higher volume vehicles where parts can be sourced locally.\n\nThe industry body is also seeking exemptions for low volume cars such as luxury models and for parts which automakers directly import as opposed to parts imported by trading companies and by vendors in the after-sales market, the sources said.\n\nIn addition to those lobbying efforts, Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW also held a meeting with the German ambassador in New Delhi in July to apprise him of the issue, sources said.\n\nUNWELCOME COMPLEXITY\n\nThe draft government notice for wheel rims calls for new rules to go into effect from Oct. 1 and includes a requirement that there be an audit of the plant where the rims are made. That would be difficult with current travel restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sources said.\n\nIt was not clear when the draft notice might be finalised.\n\nTo receive a shipment of imported cars or knocked-down car kits an order needs to be placed with global headquarters at least four months in advance, executives at two automakers said.\n\n\u201cIf there is no clarity, the headquarters will not take new orders and sales will suffer,\u201d said one of the executives.\n\nFrom April 1, 2021 similar rules will apply to windshields and other safety glass. In June, India also made it mandatory for companies to get a licence to import certain types of tyres.\n\n\u201cThis is against every tenet of ease of doing business,\u201d said a senior auto executive, noting the new rules come at a time when the pandemic has hit revenue and demand, and could discourage further investment in India.\n\n\u201cMuch more than the cost it is the complexity which affects the willingness of global companies to continue selling affected car models in India,\u201d the executive said.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:21.585745", "publish_date": "2020-09-10", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-10 10:13:23+00:00", "publish_time": "10:13:23", "source": "reuters", "title": "Exclusive: Automakers seek delays, exemptions to India's planned new rules for parts - sources", "topics": ["seek", "imported", "parts", "indias", "automakers", "sources", "rules", "exemptions", "volume", "auto", "india", "delays", "exclusive", "told", "planned", "car"]}
