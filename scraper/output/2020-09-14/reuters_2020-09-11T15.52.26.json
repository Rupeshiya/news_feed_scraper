{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "Social media users have been sharing an image online that shows President Donald J. Trump touching the face of a man with a prosthetic arm at a rally and claiming that he was a badly wounded veteran. This claim is partly false.\n\nReuters Fact Check. REUTERS\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe posts read: \u201c\u2019I remember when President Trump met a veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms. The President reached out and touched his face so he would feel the human contact.\u2019 \u2013 Mark Simone\u201d\n\nThe posts add: \u201cThis is the real Trump that the media refuses to report!\u201d\n\nMark Simone is a radio and television host who shared a Tweet with the quote ( here ). Trump retweeted this and thanked Simone ( here ).\n\nA video of the moment Trump signs the man\u2019s arm can be seen on YouTube here .\n\nAn article that has recently become paywalled identifies the man who had his bionic arm signed by Trump as Henry \u201cBubba\u201d Stevenson Jr. ( here ).\n\nSnopes confirmed the man\u2019s identity in a September 2019 article ( here ) and both Snopes and the YouTube video place the incident to a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina in 2016.\n\nStevenson was born without arms. CBS affiliate News19 explained his plans for raising money for prosthetics and his story in 2014 ( here ). Stevenson received his first prosthetic arm in 2014, according to a report by local news outlet OnlineChester.com ( here ). A 2016 post on The Firearm Blog shows him firing a gun with his feet ( here ).\n\nA GoFundMe page for Stevenson\u2019s fundraiser including a photograph of him as a child can be seen here .\n\nVERDICT\n\nPartly false.
