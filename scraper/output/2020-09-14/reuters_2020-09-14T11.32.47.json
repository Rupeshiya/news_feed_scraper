European Transport Commissioner Adina Valean said a study showed demand was not likely to pick up fast enough to lift it.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report shows that air traffic levels remain low, and more importantly, they are not likely to recover in the near future,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the lack of certainty over slots makes it difficult for airlines to plan their schedules, making planning difficult for airports and passengers.\u201d\n\nValean also urged airlines to start thinking about a return to a normal slot regime once air traffic picks up again, and said she hoped to present a proposal on this before the end of the year. She noted that the requirement that airlines use their slots was important for efficiency and fair competition.\n\n\u201cSlots are not always relinquished in time for other users or airports to plan operations as they would like; competition may also be distorted if airlines seek to benefit by increasing their market presence without using their slots and airport capacity correctly,\u201d she said.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:45.973091", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 11:32:47+00:00", "publish_time": "11:32:47", "source": "reuters", "title": "EU extends waiver until March of rule requiring airlines to use slots", "topics": ["likely", "airlines", "extends", "european", "plan", "traffic", "transport", "rule", "valean", "waiver", "requiring", "requirement", "slots", "eu"]}
