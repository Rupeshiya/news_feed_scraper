{"authors": ["Will Dunham"], "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists said on Monday they have detected in the harshly acidic clouds of Venus a gas called phosphine that indicates microbes may inhabit Earth\u2019s inhospitable neighbor, a tantalizing sign of potential life beyond Earth.\n\nData from NASA's Magellan spacecraft and Pioneer Venus Orbiter is used in an undated composite image of the planet Venus.

The international scientific team first spotted the phosphine using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii and confirmed it using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope in Chile.\n\n\u201cI was very surprised - stunned, in fact,\u201d said astronomer Jane Greaves of Cardiff University in Wales, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe existence of extraterrestrial life long has been one of the paramount questions of science. Scientists have used probes and telescopes to seek \u201cbiosignatures\u201d - indirect signs of life - on other planets and moons in our solar system and beyond.\n\n\u201cWith what we currently know of Venus, the most plausible explanation for phosphine, as fantastical as it might sound, is life,\u201d said Massachusetts Institute of Technology molecular astrophysicist and study co-author Clara Sousa-Silva.\n\n\u201cI should emphasize that life, as an explanation for our discovery, should be, as always, the last resort,\u201d Sousa-Silva added. \u201cThis is important because, if it is phosphine, and if it is life, it means that we are not alone. It also means that life itself must be very common, and there must be many other inhabited planets throughout our galaxy.\u201d\n\nPhosphine - a phosphorus atom with three hydrogen atoms attached - is highly toxic to people.\n\nEarth-based telescopes like those used in this research help scientists study the chemistry and other characteristics of celestial objects.\n\nPhosphine was seen at 20 parts-per-billion in the Venusian atmosphere, a trace concentration. Greaves said the researchers examined potential non-biological sources such as volcanism, meteorites, lightning and various types of chemical reactions, but none appeared viable. The research continues to either confirm the presence of life or find an alternative explanation.\n\nVenus is Earth\u2019s closest planetary neighbor. Similar in structure but slightly smaller than Earth, it is the second planet from the sun. Earth is the third. Venus is wrapped in a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps in heat. Surface temperatures reach a scorching 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius), hot enough to melt lead.\n\n\u201cI can only speculate on what life might survive on Venus, if indeed it is there. No life would be able to survive on the surface of Venus, because it is completely inhospitable, even for biochemistries completely different from ours,\u201d Sousa-Silva said. \u201cBut a long time ago, Venus could have had life on its surface, before a runaway greenhouse effect left the majority of the planet completely uninhabitable.\u201d\n\nTHE ACID TEST\n\nSome scientists have suspected that the Venusian high clouds, with mild temperatures around 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), could harbor aerial microbes that could endure extreme acidity. These clouds are around 90% sulphuric acid. Earth microbes could not survive that acidity.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s microorganisms, they would have access to some sunlight and water, and maybe live in liquid droplets to stop themselves dehydrating, but they would need some unknown mechanism to protect against corrosion by acid,\u201d Greaves said.\n\nOn Earth, microorganisms in \u201canaerobic\u201d environments - ecosystems that do not rely on oxygen - produce phosphine. These include sewage plants, swamps, rice fields, marshlands, lake sediments and the excrements and intestinal tracts of many animals. Phosphine also arises non-biologically in certain industrial settings.\n\nTo produce phosphine, Earth bacteria take up phosphate from minerals or biological material and add hydrogen.\n\n\u201cWe have done our very best to explain this discovery without the need for a biological process. With our current knowledge of phosphine, and Venus, and geochemistry, we cannot explain the presence of phosphine in the clouds of Venus. That doesn\u2019t mean it is life. It just means that some exotic process is producing phosphine, and our understanding of Venus needs work,\u201d Clara Sousa-Silva said.\n\nVenus should be hostile to phosphine. Its surface and atmosphere are rich in oxygen compounds that would rapidly react with and destroy phosphine.\n\n\u201cSomething must be creating the phosphine on Venus as fast as it is being destroyed,\u201d said study co-author Anita Richards, an astrophysicist associated with the University of Manchester in England.\n\nWhile previous robotic spacecraft have visited Venus, a new probe may be needed to confirm life.\n\n\u201cFortunately, Venus is right next door,\u201d Sousa-Silva said. \u201cSo we can literally go and check.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:44.337960", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 15:07:16+00:00", "publish_time": "15:07:16", "source": "reuters", "title": "Potential sign of alien life detected on inhospitable Venus", "topics": ["detected", "alien", "degrees", "potential", "venus", "surface", "inhospitable", "phosphine", "earth", "life", "sousasilva", "scientists", "clouds", "sign", "used"]}
