{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "(Reuters) - Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O rose 3.2% on Monday, reversing their premarket losses as investors shrugged off concerns over the steep premium the U.S. drugmaker was willing to pay for Immunomedics Inc IMMU.O.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Gilead Sciences Inc pharmaceutical company in Oceanside, California, U.S., April 29, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nGilead on Sunday agreed to buy the biopharmaceutical company for $21 billion and acquire all the outstanding shares of Immunomedics for $88 per share, at a premium of about 108% over Friday\u2019s closing price of $42.25.\n\nThe deal gives Gilead access to Immunomedics\u2019 cancer treatment drug, Trodelvy, which was granted an accelerated approval in April by the U.S. Food and Drug administration for an aggressive and tough-to-treat type of breast cancer.\n\nBrokerage Jefferies said investors may take some time to digest the deal, but it believed the deal offered a path for Gilead to quickly move into the solid tumors market.\n\nBrokerage Oppenheimer views the purchase price as \u201creasonable\u201d, and said the cancer drug \u201cslots neatly\u201d in Gilead\u2019s oncology strategy.\n\nEarlier in the day, at least two brokerages raised concerns about the deal price.\n\nBaird said Trodelvy should give Gilead a \u201cnice addition\u201d to cement its foothold in the cancer treatment sphere, but that it was \u201cless than thrilled\u201d about the price.\n\nSVB Leerink expected the main push back from investors to be about the deal price, not the product or the commercial opportunity.\n\n\u201cGilead\u2019s purchase price is at a 300% premium to where Immunomedics traded at the start of the year, and more than 100% higher than where the stock had recently traded,\u201d the brokerage said.\n\nGilead\u2019s shares rose 3.3% to $67 in morning trading, after falling as much as 2% before the opening bell on Monday.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:34.488523", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 15:57:30+00:00", "publish_time": "15:57:30", "source": "reuters", "title": "Gilead's shares rise after $21 billion deal for Immunomedics", "topics": ["immunomedics", "cancer", "billion", "21", "shares", "drug", "premium", "rise", "price", "trodelvy", "gilead", "deal", "gileads", "investors"]}
