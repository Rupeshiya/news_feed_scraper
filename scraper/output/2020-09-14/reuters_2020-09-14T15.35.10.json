REUTERS/Patrick Doyle/File Photo\n\nOTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will announce on Tuesday that it is going ahead with a threat to slap retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods after Washington said it would impose punitive measures on Canadian aluminum imports, CTV said on Monday.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said last month that Ottawa would impose sanctions on C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) worth of U.S. aluminum and products containing aluminum. The measures would come into force by Sept 16, she added.\n\nCanada promised to retaliate after U.S. President Donald Trump moved in August to reimpose 10% tariffs on some Canadian aluminum products to protect U.S. industry from a \u201csurge\u201d in imports. Canada denies any impropriety.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Canada understands aluminum from Canada is no threat to national security in the United States,\u201d Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters on Monday ahead of a cabinet retreat in Ottawa.\n\nChampagne noted that Ottawa had slapped tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods in 2018 after Washington imposed sanctions on Canadian aluminum and steel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a formula that we have already used and it\u2019s the formula that we\u2019ll use this time as well,\u201d he said. Freeland\u2019s office said it could not confirm an announcement would be made on Tuesday.\n\n($1=1.3173 Canadian dollars)", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:35.095524", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 15:35:10+00:00", "publish_time": "15:35:10", "source": "reuters", "title": "Canada to unveil retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods on Tuesday: CTV", "topics": ["threat", "sanctions", "aluminum", "washington", "tariffs", "minister", "canadian", "ctv", "goods", "reporters", "canada", "ottawa", "retaliatory", "unveil"]}
