{"authors": ["Nqobile Dludla"], "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Sitting in a hair salon as a stylist braids her natural hair, Sana Sebone recalls a time in 2013 when she worked on a construction site and was told her dreadlocks were too long and represented a hazard.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nShe was upset, she said, mainly because her white colleagues with long hair were not told the same as their hair was considered \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nSeven years on, that term is haunting her again after an advert was released by TRESemm\u00e9, a Unilever UNA.ASULVR.L brand, describing images of African Black hair as \"frizzy and dull\" and \"dry and damaged\" while a white woman's hair was referred to as \"normal\".\n\n\u201cIt really upset me,\u201d said 30-year-old Sebone, who turned to dreadlocks after tiring of straightening her natural hair to make it look \u201cpresentable\u201d in others\u2019 eyes.\n\nUnilever has apologised for the advert, which it admitted was \"racist\", while TRESemm\u00e9 South Africa and Drugstore Clicks Group CLSJ.J, on whose website the advert was posted, have also apologised.\n\n\u201cWe are in the year 2020. How ignorant can you be to still think Black women\u2019s natural hair is ugly, is fuzzy and is all those negative words?,\u201d Sebone said at the salon in Midrand, a suburb in northern Johannesburg.\n\nThe advert caused an outcry on social media and sparked protests led by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters in a country where unfair treatment of people based on their hair evokes painful memories of prejudice during apartheid, which ended in 1994.\n\nIn those years, a \u201cpencil test\u201d was used to determine someone\u2019s racial identity: A pencil was inserted into a person\u2019s hair and if it did not fall out, that person was considered not white.\n\n\u201cOur forefathers have fought this. Are we still fighting this? When will it end?,\u201d said 48-year-old Nomsa Nyathi as she sat under a hair steamer at the salon.\n\nBlack hair is still policed in places like schools, where Black girls with natural afros or dreadlocks are sometimes suspended for not \u201cwearing their hair right\u201d or are asked to straighten their hair.\n\n\u201cEverything about being a Black female in South Africa or even in the world screams \u2018You\u2019re not good enough, you don\u2019t fit in here, you\u2019re not wanted here\u2019,\u201d said 42-year-old Ntombenhle Khathwane, founder of Black hair products brand AfroBotanics.\n\nKhathwane herself remembers being told in high school that her dreadlocks did not align with the school\u2019s neatness policy.\n\nUnilever has pulled all TRESemm\u00e9 products from South African retail stores for 10 days. Its South African unit has moved to set up an advisory board and a diversity committee.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:44.695986", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 11:41:49+00:00", "publish_time": "11:41:49", "source": "reuters", "title": "TRESemm\u00e9 hair ad angers South Africans still hurting from racist past", "topics": ["tresemm\u00e9", "south", "advert", "angers", "african", "ad", "past", "hurting", "racist", "sebone", "africans", "hair", "black", "told", "dreadlocks", "natural"]}
