{"authors": ["Devjyot Ghoshal"], "body": "LEH, India (Reuters) - Two Indian officials said Chinese troops were laying a network of optical fibre cables at a western Himalayan flashpoint with India, suggesting they were digging in for the long haul despite high-level talks aimed at resolving a standoff there.\n\nSnow-covered mountain range is seen from a passenger airplane in Ladakh region September 14, 2020. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nSuch cables, which would provide forward troops with secure lines of communication to bases in the rear, have recently been spotted to the south of Pangong Tso lake in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, a senior government official said.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions on the matter from Reuters, while defence officials could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThousands of Indian and Chinese troops backed by tanks and aircraft are locked in an uneasy stalemate along a 70 km-long front to the south of the lake. Each country has accused the other of escalating the standoff.\n\nA third Indian official said on Monday that there had been no significant withdrawals or reinforcements on either side since the foreign ministers of the two countries met last week.[nL4N2G808D]\n\n\u201cIt is as tense as earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nAbove Leh, Ladakh\u2019s main city, Indian fighter planes flew throughout the morning, their engines booming and echoing across the valley surrounded by brown, barren mountains.\n\n\u201cOur biggest worry is that they have laid optical fibre cables for high-speed communications,\u201d the first official said, referring to the lake\u2019s southern bank, where Indian and Chinese troops are only a few hundred metres apart at some points.\n\n\u201cThey have been laying optical fibre cables on the southern bank at breakneck speed,\u201d he said.\n\nIndian intelligence agencies noted similar cables to the north of the Pangong Tso lake around a month ago, the second government official said.\n\nThe first Indian government official said the authorities were alerted to such activity after satellite imagery showed unusual lines in the sand of the high-altitude deserts to the south of Pangong Tso.\n\nThese lines were judged by Indian experts - and corroborated by foreign intelligence agencies - to be communication cables laid in trenches, he said, including near the Spanggur gap, among hilltops where soldiers fired in the air recently for the first time in decades. [nL4N2G51KK]\n\nIndian officials say a build-up in border infrastructure on their side is also likely to have played a part in the months-long confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese have complained about India building roads and air strips in and around their disputed border, and Beijing says this triggered tensions along the border.\n\nA former Indian military intelligence official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said optical fibre cables offered communications security as well as the ability to send data such as pictures and documents.\n\n\u201cIf you speak on radio, it can get caught. Communications on optical fibre cables is secure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Indian military still depends on radio communications, the first official said, although he said it was encrypted.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:07.391110", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 13:18:26+00:00", "publish_time": "13:18:26", "source": "reuters", "title": "India says China laying cables to bolster communications at border flashpoint", "topics": ["china", "south", "troops", "official", "bolster", "indian", "india", "communications", "flashpoint", "border", "optical", "fibre", "laying", "pangong", "chinese", "cables"]}
