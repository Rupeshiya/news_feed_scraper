The EU says progress has been made on issues such as forced technology transfer, but wants China to open up sectors such as telecoms, IT, health, financial services and manufacturing.\n\nBrussels also wants the same level of access to agriculture and food markets that China gave to the United States in their phase 1 trade agreement struck in January.\n\nChina believes the investment accord should be a stepping stone to a free-trade agreement.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nThe EU wants China, the world\u2019s top polluter, to bring forward the year of peak emissions to 2025 from 2030. It is also urging Beijing to commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2060.\n\nChina is planning to an emissions-trading system, but the system has still not started. Other developing nations are reluctant to move if China does not.\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS/HONG KONG\n\nThe EU is critical of the arrests of dozens of pro-democracy activists this year in Hong Kong, including two opposition lawmakers last month.\n\nThe bloc has added its voice to an international outcry over a new national security law in the former British colony, saying Beijing is undermining basic rights in the Chinese-ruled territory.\n\nThe EU has also protested against China\u2019s Uighur Muslim crackdown. The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region.\n\nDISINFORMATION/DIGITAL\n\nEU officials say China has sought to pressure EU countries that criticise its handling of COVID-19, by using social media to spread fake reports of European neglect of patients. Beijing has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe EU is also concerned about investment in European technology by state-subsidised Chinese firms and said it would be particularly vigilant on critical areas such as micro-electronics and artificial intelligence.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:45.645441", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 16:16:46+00:00", "publish_time": "16:16:46", "source": "reuters", "title": "Factbox: Trade, climate, Hong Kong to dominate EU-China video summit", "topics": ["dominate", "china", "xi", "video", "climate", "technology", "president", "trade", "hong", "factbox", "euchina", "beijing", "kong", "eu", "summit", "wants", "united", "european"]}
