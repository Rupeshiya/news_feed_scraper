{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "HARARE (Reuters) - Eleven young elephants found dead near Zimbabwe\u2019s biggest game park may have succumbed to a bacterial infection, the country\u2019s parks agency said on Tuesday, after it ruled out poaching and cyanide poisoning.\n\nA group of elephants are seen near a watering hole inside Hwange National Park, in Zimbabwe, October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo\n\nThe elephant carcasses were discovered last Friday in Pandamasuwe Forest in western Zimbabwe, between Hwange National Park and Victoria Falls.\n\nThe mysterious deaths came after Botswana reported the death of more than 200 elephants in June.\n\nColumbus Chaitezvi, principal veterinary officer at the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) said that, following preliminary tests, the agency suspected the elephants could have contracted a deadly bacterial infection while searching for food.\n\nAs the country enters the hot summer season, food becomes scarce and younger elephants tend to eat grass and burrow into the soil, exposing themselves to bacteria, he said.\n\n\u201cSo far the laboratory indication is that it\u2019s a bacteria infection but we don\u2019t know what kind of bacteria it is,\u201d Chaitezvi told Reuters.\n\nZimparks spokesman Tinashe Farawo said the dead were aged between five and six years and less than 18 months.\n\n\u201cYou can see that those young ones can\u2019t reach for tree tops, so they end up eating anything, which in some cases can be poisonous,\u201d said Farawo.\n\nChris Foggin, whose Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust laboratory is helping with testing samples and also previously tested samples from Botswana, said so far there were no similarities between the elephant deaths in the two countries.\n\nAt least 200 elephants have died in Zimbabwe\u2019s wildlife parks due to lack of food and water, along with scores of buffalo and antelope, since a devastating drought in 2019.\n\nZimparks officials say the biggest threat to Zimbabwe\u2019s elephants is overpopulation and that lower rainfall this year could again leave the animals facing starvation.\n\nZimbabwe is home to some 80,000 elephants, around a fifth of Africa\u2019s total, conservationists estimate. Overall numbers have declined sharply in recent years, mostly due to a combination of poaching, illegal hunting and drought.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:31.421379", "publish_date": "2020-09-01", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-01 11:47:57+00:00", "publish_time": "11:47:57", "source": "reuters", "title": "Zimbabwe suspects elephants died from bacterial infection", "topics": ["elephants", "young", "parks", "bacterial", "zimbabwe", "wildlife", "zimbabwes", "victoria", "park", "bacteria", "infection", "died", "suspects"]}
