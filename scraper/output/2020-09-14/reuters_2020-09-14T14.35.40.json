{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "(Reuters) - World number one Novak Djokovic says he cannot guarantee he will not make a similar mistake that led to his disqualification at the U.S. Open for striking a line judge with a ball but he remains confident it will not affect his tennis in the future.\n\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic during a practice session Pool via REUTERS/Clive Brunskill\n\nThe Serb was disqualified in the fourth round in New York when he hit a ball in frustration after dropping serve in the first set against Spain\u2019s Pablo Carreno Busta, hitting the line judge in her throat and causing her to fall to the floor.\n\nDjokovic, who had already apologised for the incident, said that he called on the lineswoman to check on her health since the incident at Flushing Meadows.\n\n\u201cI cannot promise or cannot guarantee that I will never ever do anything similar to that in my life,\u201d Djokovic told a news conference at the Italian Open on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the best version of myself on the court and off the court and I understand that I have outbursts and this is kind of the personality and the player that I have always been.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take this in as profound as possible for me as a big lesson.\u201d\n\nFollowing the incident, the tournament organisers confirmed Djokovic was fined $250,000 -- his prize money for reaching round four. The 33-year-old was also fined an additional $10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of speculation about whether it was deserved. I accepted it, I moved on,\u201d Djokovic added. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t forget about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget about it.\u201d\n\nThe disqualification, however, gave Djokovic more time to regroup before his claycourt opener at this week\u2019s Italian Open.\n\nHaving won 26 of 27 matches on tour this season, Djokovic remains one of the favourites to win the French Open, which begins on Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great I have a tournament a week or 10 days after it happened because I feel the earlier I get back in competition mode the faster I\u2019ll overcome the memory and re-programme it. I\u2019m hoping for the best,\u201d said the 17-times Grand Slam winner.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:29.509854", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 14:35:40+00:00", "publish_time": "14:35:40", "source": "reuters", "title": "'A big lesson': Djokovic ready to move on from U.S. Open default", "topics": ["similar", "incident", "judge", "lesson", "remains", "open", "round", "ready", "default", "novak", "djokovic", "line", "tournament", "big"]}
