REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nCREST\u2019s owner, Euroclear, reported intermittent delays which it believed were related to back-up procedures that it had to take on Friday when the system experienced an outage.\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and taking actions to resolve any issues with the utmost priority,\u201d Euroclear said.\n\nEuroclear said late in the afternoon that a full settlement service had resumed.\n\nCREST is the central securities depository for share and UK government bond markets in the United Kingdom and for Irish stocks.\n\nThe BoE had been due to hold a regular 1.5 billion-pound buy-back of British government bonds on Monday as part of its programme to help the economy cope with the coronavirus shock.\n\n\u201cDue to ongoing technical problems in CREST settlement, the Bank announces that it will not hold gilt purchase operations today,\u201d the BoE said early on Monday.\n\nA banker involved in the sale of government bonds said the problems had not caused significant disruption but needed to be fixed before the government\u2019s next scheduled sales of bonds on Tuesday at which it is seeking to raise 4.5 billion pounds.\n\n\u201cThey need to look into it urgently,\u201d the banker said.\n\nA spokesman for the Debt Management Office said its business operations were continuing as normal, \u201cincluding the auctions currently scheduled for tomorrow\u201d.\n\nCREST first went down on Friday after suffering technical issues, requiring the BoE to switch to back-up procedures to settle transactions.\n\nOwner Euroclear said on Sunday the system would reopen early on Monday in time for the reopening of financial markets.\n\nA spokeswoman for the BoE said the central bank had decided \u201cas a precaution\u201d to delay Monday\u2019s short-maturity gilt purchase operation until Thursday. Gilt purchase operations due to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday were unaffected.\n\nThere was no impact on consumer payments, the BoE said.\n\nA Western security source said he was unaware of any hostile activity such as a cyber-attack on CREST.\n\n($1 = 0.7782 pounds)", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:01.920370", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 09:13:29+00:00", "publish_time": "09:13:29", "source": "reuters", "title": "CREST problems return, Bank of England delays gilt buy-back", "topics": ["settlement", "system", "purchase", "buyback", "england", "return", "gilt", "euroclear", "bank", "technical", "delays", "boe", "problems", "operations", "crest"]}
