Graeme Jennings/Pool via REUTERS\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday said there still could be a deal with Congress for more federal coronavirus aid, a day after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also voiced optimism despite the Senate\u2019s failure to pass an aid bill last week.\n\n\u201cI will continue to work on this. I\u2019ve told the speaker I\u2019m available anytime to negotiate, no conditions,\u201d he told CNBC in an interview.\n\nEfforts to provide additional financial aid amid the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic have stalled all summer even as the number of U.S. cases continues to climb, now exceeding 6.5 million. More than 194,000 people in the United States have died from COVID-19, which has also rocked the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nPelosi and fellow Democrats who control the House of Representatives passed their $3.4 trillion aid bill in mid-May. The Republican-led Senate failed to get traction on a $1 trillion counterproposal before taking up a slimmed-down $300 billion measure last week that failed to pass.\n\nAsked about executive actions Trump could take if Congress doesn\u2019t reach a deal, Mnuchin noted: \u201cThere are limitations. That\u2019s why it very important that we have stimulus that helps areas of the economy that need support.\u201d\n\nHe added that he looked forward to a bipartisan proposal from lawmakers expected as soon as Monday. Politico reported the so-called Problem Solvers caucus was preparing a plan that would drop Democrats\u2019 demand for more state and local aid, which had become a sticking point with the Trump administration. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.\n\nMnuchin separately told reporters at the White House that he expected details of a continuing resolution to fund U.S. government agencies past Sept. 30 to be finalized this week.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:19.534624", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 12:47:12+00:00", "publish_time": "12:47:12", "source": "reuters", "title": "Mnuchin says he will continue to work on COVID-19 deal: CNBC", "topics": ["week", "cnbc", "trillion", "speaker", "aid", "trump", "work", "coronavirus", "covid19", "house", "continue", "told", "mnuchin", "deal", "treasury"]}
