{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "Posts on social media allege news outlets have remained silent about dozens of children found in Ohio, Georgia and Michigan. The operations \u2013 recently in Ohio and Georgia, but in 2018 in Michigan - were in fact all covered by various news organizations.\n\nReuters Fact Check. REUTERS\n\nA post shared over almost 100,000 times on Facebook here reads: \u201c25 children found in Ohio! 39 children found in Georgia! 123 more found in Michigan! Media SILENT Why are these not huge stories?\u201d\n\nOther examples are visible here , here and here .\n\nSome iterations of the claim here , here allude to the children being victims of sex-trafficking. However, that does not appear to be the case for most of the minors found in these operations.\n\nThis claim appears to speak to the prevalence of narratives presented by QAnon, a group best known for spreading a conspiracy theory about a fake child-trafficking ring at a Washington pizzeria ( here , here , here ).\n\nOHIO\n\nThe claim likely refers to 25 children found in \u201cOperation Safety Net,\u201d a 20-day mission by the U.S. Marshals and authorities in Ohio to locate endangered children in August of this year.\n\nAccording to local media reports ( here , here , here ) , 25 Ohio children between the ages of 13 and 18 were located in several cities in Ohio, including Cleveland and Akron, as well as in Miami, Florida.\n\nCBS reported here that a quarter of the children rescued were cases related to human trafficking or prostitution.\n\nOther outlets that covered the story are visible here , here and here.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nThe 39 children mentioned in the claim likely refer to \u201cOperation Not Forgotten\u201d, a joint sweep by U.S. Marshals and other Georgia state and local agencies during August 2020 ( here ).\n\nDave Oney, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals, told Reuters via email that \u201cthe majority of the children were located in Georgia, but others were found in South Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Florida, Kentucky and Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe operation resulted in safely locating 13 children and the rescue of an additional 26 \u201ccritically missing\u201d children, as well as the arrest of nine criminal associates. According to the U.S. Marshals, fifteen of these 39 minors were sex-trafficking victims.\n\nVarious outlets covered the story, some examples visible here , here , here and here .\n\nReuters recently clarified the claim that the children in this operation had all been found inside a trailer in Georgia, here .\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nThe claim refers to an operation in Michigan on Sept. 26, 2018. At the time, the operation triggered confusion and also led to misinformation, according to local news reports ( here ).\n\nAs reported by The Detroit News here , the eight-hour sweep was led by state police, though U.S. Marshals also participated.\n\nAll but four of the 107 children located during the operation were found safe with parents or guardians. Three were identified as possible sex trafficking cases.\n\nAt the time, a press release by the U.S. Marshals (which is no longer available online) reported that 123 children \u201cwere identified and recovered safely\u201d, but the total included 16 cases from a previous sweep.\n\nThe release also led to a series of news reports that referred to the sweep as a sex trafficking \u201csting\u201d here. The Detroit News\u2019 crime reporter George Hunter wrote about the confusion in a Twitter thread here .\n\nWhen asked about this case, Oney told Reuters that the headlines were \u201ca bit misleading\u201d and said that while the U.S. Marshals \u201cwere able to help close these cases, that doesn\u2019t mean we rescued 123 children.\u201d\n\nOther media reports on the operation are visible here , here , here , and here\n\nSome iterations of the claim here also falsely refer to \u201c60 children found in Delaware\u201d. Reuters previously debunked this claim here .\n\nVERDICT\n\nPartly false. 25 and 39 children were indeed recently located in operations in Ohio and Georgia but contrary to the posts\u2019 assertion, media did cover these stories. Media also covered the location of 107 reportedly missing children in Michigan, though that was in September 2018.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
