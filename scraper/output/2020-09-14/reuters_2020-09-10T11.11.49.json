REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nBorrowing plans for the second half of the financial year, ending on March 31, will be reviewed by government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials later this month, the five sources said.\n\nThe officials have already discussed the possibility of monetising the debt, whereby the central bank prints money to bridge the fiscal deficit, but they were in no hurry to return to a bad habit India kicked in 1997.\n\n\u201cThere will definitely be higher borrowing in the current year but whether we will print money, that is not yet decided. We will have to have patience and see how things go,\u201d a senior official said.\n\nA senior government official said debt monetization was \u201cnot the preferred option right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen what some of the countries have done in this regard, but we think that such a move would be the last resort for us,\u201d the official added.\n\nAside from potentially harming India\u2019s credit rating, monetisation carries inflation risks that would be politically worrying in a country where voters are extremely sensitive to changes in food prices.\n\nThe senior government official said the central bank could ease liquidity through open market operations to keep yields in check while helping the government to increase borrowing, already targeted at a record 12 trillion rupees ($163 billion).\n\nRBI has pumped in over 11 trillion rupees of liquidity into the market, helping to keep 10-year bond yields below 6% even as the government decided to borrow 70% more than last year as a result of the pandemic.\n\nDespite being under one of the strictest lockdowns for over four months India currently has the second highest number of coronavirus cases globally with economic activity curtailed and government revenues severely affected.\n\nIndia\u2019s GDP contracted 23.9% on year in the April-June quarter, with Goldman Sachs now projecting a full-year contraction of 14.8%.\n\nOfficials, however, are still pinning some hopes on raising revenue from the sale of the state-owned firms even though they do not expect to meet the target of over 2 trillion rupees for divestment sales this year.\n\n\u201cThe dilemma over deficit monetisation is not unique to India,\u201d said Radhika Rao, economist with DBS. \u201cThe primary challenge is to communicate and ensure that this is a one-off pandemic-induced arrangement and not a recurrent financing line.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:21.697564", "publish_date": "2020-09-10", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-10 11:11:49+00:00", "publish_time": "11:11:49", "source": "reuters", "title": "Pandemic likely to force India to borrow more, deficit monetisation is last resort: sources", "topics": ["trillion", "likely", "sources", "monetisation", "official", "coronavirus", "bank", "borrow", "india", "senior", "force", "pandemic", "yields", "deficit", "resort", "rupees"]}
