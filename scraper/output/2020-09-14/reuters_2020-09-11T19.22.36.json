{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "With 54 days until the Nov. 3 presidential election, President Donald Trump said on Twitter ( here ) and Facebook ( here ) on Thursday that 80 million mail-in ballots were being sent to voters who had not requested them, calling the situation \u201cunfair and a total fraud in the making.\u201d While certain states are automatically sending ballots to their voters for this election, in many others, these still need to be requested.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at MBS International Airport, in Freeland, Michigan, U.S., September 10, 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nVoting by mail has a long history of reliability in the United States, serving as the primary method of voting in Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Hawaii, which automatically send registered voters mail-in ballots. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont, and Washington, D.C. have introduced the same procedure for the 2020 vote ( here ) .\n\nBenjamin Hovland, commissioner of the independent, bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC, here , www.eac.gov/about-the-useac ) echoed to Reuters via phone that \u201cin more states than ever, election authorities will automatically send a ballot to each registered voter.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reuters\u2019 calculations, there are an estimated 44.2 million registered voters, or about half the number mentioned by President Trump, in the 10 states and jurisdictions automatically sending out ballots for the Nov. 3 election.\n\nReuters found this number by adding up the latest available voter registration statistics for Colorado ( here ); Hawaii, ( here ); Oregon ( here ); Utah ( here ); Washington ( here ); California ( here ); Washington, D.C ( here ); Nevada ( here ); New Jersey ( here ); and Vermont ( here ).\n\n\u201cOn the states where these ballots are sent automatically, those were state-legislated decisions to make those policies,\u201d Commissioner Hovland said, adding that \u201cthose states have implemented security measures on their respective mail-in processes.\u201d\n\nFor the remaining states not sending out proactive ballots, Hovland noted \u201cvotes still require an affirmative request from the voter.\u201d The millions of voters in these states would have to actively solicit or request a ballot.\n\nIt is possible that Trump\u2019s 80 million unsolicited ballot claim stemmed from an Aug. 14 analysis from the New York Times ( here ), which stated that experts predict \u201croughly 80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.\u201d\n\nThe president first mentioned this figure during his Labor Day press conference on Sept. 7, referring to \u201cthe issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested\u201d as \u201cthe dirtiest fight of all\u201d ( here ).\n\nLinking the high volume of \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail ballots to voter fraud, he said, \u201cPeople are going to get ballots; they\u2019re going to say, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019 And then they\u2019re going to harvest. They\u2019re going to do all the things.\u201d\n\nThe claim feeds into a narrative echoed by President Trump that mail-in voting, expected to nearly double due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will increase voter fraud ( here ).\n\nAfter weeks of repeatedly raising concerns about mail-in voting, Trump on Aug. 4 called Florida\u2019s election system \u201cSafe and Secure, Tried and True\u201d and urged voters in the Republican state to vote by any means, including by mail ( here).\n\nExperts say that election fraud is very rare in the United States, where nearly one in four voters cast a mail-in or absentee ballot in 2016 (here).\n\nThere are multiple layers of security in place for mail-in ballots, also known as \u201cabsentee\u201d ballots, including the Electronic Registration Information Center ( www.ericstates.org ) and adherence to the National Voter Registration Act\u2019s list of maintenance procedures ( here , here).\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures provides information on home voting, including a section on security features in place here .\n\nMeasures to counter voter fraud include hand-marked paper ballots, signature verification, examining and processing ballots ahead of election day to allow for more verification time, up-to-date address information, security cameras during storage, and many more (see Security Features of Voting by Absentee/Mailed Ballots section here bit.ly/33vUvBA ).\n\nFurther information on security measures to ensure ballot integrity can be found here .\n\nCommissioner Hovland told Reuters these sort of unfounded claims \u201cignore the repeated calls of elections professionals, both Democrat and Republican, that say this is a safe, normal process with procedures in place to ensure the process upholds the integrity of an election.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team has previously debunked several viral claims linking the use of mail-in ballots to voter fraud: here , here , and here .\n\nVERDICT\n\nFalse. 80 million \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots will not be sent to voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Ten states and jurisdictions are proactively sending out ballots, some for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic, for an approximately 44.2 million registered voters in total.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
