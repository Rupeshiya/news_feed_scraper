{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s largest economy is set to continue recovering from the coronavirus crisis in the remainder of 2020 and will likely grow strongly in the third quarter but it probably will not reach its pre-crisis level until 2022, the German Economy Ministry said.\n\nThe trough of the recession was reached in the second quarter and the easing of lockdown measures since May led to a rapid recovery in industry and in some service sectors, the ministry said in its monthly report on Monday, adding that the revival has lost some steam lately though.\n\n\u201cThe German economy is continuing to pick up, albeit at a more moderate pace,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nEconomists expect Europe\u2019s biggest economy to show a return to growth in the third quarter after a record 9.7% contraction in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and exports all collapsed.\n\nThe ministry said significant economic growth was likely in the third quarter thanks to impetus from May and June, when there were signs of a rebound.\n\nIt said exports remained far from their pre-coronavirus levels and while industrial production had returned to almost 90% of its pre-coronavirus level and was continuing to rise, it had lost some momentum.\n\nEarlier this month, the German government revised upward its economic forecast for this year to a decline of 5.8% from a previously expected slump of 6.3%.\n\nA temporary cut in Germany\u2019s value-added tax (VAT) as part of the government\u2019s stimulus package and a child bonus are also expected to boost domestic demand in the second half of the year, it added.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:10.010609", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 08:13:28+00:00", "publish_time": "08:13:28", "source": "reuters", "title": "German economic recovery to continue in second-half, third-quarter to show strong growth: ministry", "topics": ["economy", "likely", "economic", "secondhalf", "ministry", "thirdquarter", "german", "second", "quarter", "growth", "lost", "precoronavirus", "continue", "level", "strong", "recovery"]}
