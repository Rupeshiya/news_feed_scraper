REUTERS/Tingshu Wang\n\n\u201cFinancial and political investments in preparedness have been insufficient, and we are all paying the price,\u201d said the report by The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB).\n\n\u201cIt is not as if the world has lacked the opportunity to take these steps,\u201d it said. \u201cThere have been numerous calls for action ... yet none has generated the changes needed.\u201d\n\nThe GPMB, co-convened by the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), is co-chaired by former WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland.\n\nThe board\u2019s 2019 report, released a few months before the novel coronavirus emerged in China, said there was a real threat of \u201ca rapidly spreading pandemic due to a lethal respiratory pathogen\u201d and warned such an event could kill millions and wreak havoc on the global economy.\n\nThis year\u2019s report - entitled \u201cA World in Disorder\u201d - said world leaders had never before \u201cbeen so clearly forewarned of the dangers of a devastating pandemic\u201d, and yet they had failed to take adequate action.\n\n\u201cTragically and catastrophically, we have seen our worst fears realised,\u201d Brundtland told a media briefing on Monday. \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 is even worse than we anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed \u201ca collective failure to take pandemic prevention, preparedness and response seriously and prioritize it accordingly\u201d, the report said.\n\n\u201cPathogens thrive in disruption and disorder. COVID-19 has proven the point.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that despite calling a year ago for heads of government to commit and invest in pandemic preparedness, for health systems to be strengthened and for financial risk planning to take seriously the threat of a devastating pandemic, little progress had been made on any of these.\n\nA lack of leadership, it said, was exacerbating the current pandemic. \u201cFailure to learn the lessons of COVID-19 or to act on them with the necessary resources and commitment will mean that the next pandemic, which is sure to come, will be even more damaging,\u201d it said.\n\nJeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity and a member of the monitoring board, urged leaders not to repeat the same mistakes. \u201cThis needs more than warm words of solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs a moment of visionary, historic, political and financial leadership.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:10.217604", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 04:08:00+00:00", "publish_time": "04:08:00", "source": "reuters", "title": "Pandemic preparedness panel slams collective failure to heed warnings", "topics": ["warnings", "slams", "political", "failure", "report", "heed", "global", "collective", "preparedness", "covid19", "leaders", "health", "pandemic", "panel", "world"]}
