REUTERS/Mark Schiefelbein/Pool\n\nWASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad will step down to work on President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said on Monday, departing Beijing at a time when the ties between the world\u2019s top two economies are at their worst in decades.\n\nBranstad, previously the longest-serving governor of Iowa, a state in the U.S. Farm Belt which helped Trump get elected in 2016, will leave China in early October, the U.S. embassy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI thank Ambassador Terry Branstad for his more than three years of service to the American people as U.S. Ambassador to the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. \u201cAmbassador Branstad has contributed to rebalancing U.S.-China relations so that it is results-oriented, reciprocal, and fair.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Trump hinted that Branstad might be joining the campaign. In a video posted on Twitter by Iowa senator Joni Ernst, Trump said Branstad would be coming home.\n\nBranstad\u2019s departure leaves the U.S. mission in Beijing without a confirmed ambassador at a time when the two countries are at loggerheads over everything from China\u2019s new security law in Hong Kong to handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic and over territorial matters in the South China Sea.\n\nThat gap could last for months even if Trump is re-elected on Nov. 3. The Senate is only scheduled to be in session for about two more weeks before Election Day.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry has in the past described Branstad, who was instrumental in a so-called Phase One trade deal with China, as an \u201cold friend of the Chinese people\u201d. He first forged ties with President Xi Jinping several decades ago when Xi visited Iowa.\n\nLast week, the United States and China traded attacks about who best understands press freedom after the official People\u2019s Daily refused to publish an article by Branstad.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:19.380369", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 07:58:34+00:00", "publish_time": "07:58:34", "source": "reuters", "title": "U.S. ambassador to China Branstad leaving post to help Trump campaign: U.S. official", "topics": ["leaving", "china", "ambassador", "help", "xi", "trump", "ties", "state", "official", "campaign", "post", "president", "beijing", "branstad", "terry"]}
