REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo\n\nThe warning in a letter to its 130,000 staff from Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, seen by Reuters, marks a more pessimistic tone from the planemaker, which had previously said only that it could not rule out compulsory measures.\n\n\u201cI owe it to you to be transparent: it\u2019s unlikely that voluntary departures will be enough,\u201d Faury wrote in the letter distributed on Friday evening.\n\nUnions and the French government have urged the Toulouse-based planemaker to avoid compulsory layoffs as it sheds up to 15,000 posts to cope with plummeting travel demand.\n\nAirbus has repeatedly warned that the outlook is uncertain as the industry\u2019s worst crisis hits aircraft deliveries and severely weakens airline finances.\n\nBut a disappointing rise in air travel over the summer has cast a fresh pall over the company\u2019s biggest ever restructuring plans.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the recovery in airline traffic over the summer period has not been at the level the industry was counting on,\u201d Faury wrote.\n\n\u201cWe must now prepare for a crisis that will probably be even deeper and longer than the previous scenarios suggested\u201d.\n\nThe group representing most of the world\u2019s airlines, the International Air Transport Association, said last week that air traffic had failed to recover as quickly as expected during July, a key part of the peak season for airline revenues.\n\nJuly traffic was down 80% compared with the same month of 2019, compared with a 94% drop at the low point in April.\n\nIATA says inconsistent border rules are hampering the recovery, making it difficult for airlines to plan ahead.\n\nAirbus reported solid deliveries for August, but industry sources say many aircraft are going straight into storage.\n\nAn Airbus spokesman confirmed that Faury had issued a \u201cgeneral business update\u201d to staff.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the constant dialogue between Airbus\u2019 top management and employees, which is crucial in these challenging times in order to ensure transparency and share information with our global workforce,\u201d the spokesman said by email.\n\nHe declined further comment.\n\nAn official with France\u2019s CGT union accused Airbus of deliberately stoking up staff anxieties ahead of further labour negotiations starting in one week.\n\nAirbus has so far launched an internal call for voluntary departures and early retirements, in a scheme expected to run until the end of the year.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:09.408949", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 16:48:55+00:00", "publish_time": "16:48:55", "source": "reuters", "title": "Airbus CEO warns of compulsory layoffs as airline crisis deepens", "topics": ["airline", "layoffs", "airbus", "ceo", "voluntary", "warns", "traffic", "compulsory", "air", "crisis", "faury", "expected", "travel", "deepens"]}
