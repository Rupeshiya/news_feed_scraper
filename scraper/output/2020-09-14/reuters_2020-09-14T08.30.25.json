REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nvidia has played a risky opening chess move. The U.S. listed graphics-chip specialist led by Jensen Huang will buy UK chip designer Arm from SoftBank and its Vision Fund in a deal worth up to $40 billion. But Arm\u2019s customers and regulators may baulk, and the chunky price tag presupposes huge growth and market share gains.\n\nHuang is the industry\u2019s most prescient boss. His track record of moving into promising, fast-growing markets like chips for video games and more recently, data centres, has helped more than triple Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation to $300 billion since 2019. Now it will pay $21.5 billion in shares and $12 billion in cash for Arm, and an additional $5 billion if the target hits certain financial targets down the line. SoftBank will end up with as much as 8.1% in the enlarged group, which will also issue $1.5 billion worth of stock to Arm employees.\n\nCombining Arm\u2019s computing expertise with its new parent\u2019s technology in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and more will create a powerful player in booming markets: Nvidia forecasts the addressable market for data centres will hit $80 billion by 2023, for example. Arm\u2019s business model of licensing out intellectual property will also benefit from more R&D as well as from offering Nvidia\u2019s technologies to customers. The deal implies an enterprise value of at least $33.5 billion or, with the earn-out, a decent increase on the $32 billion SoftBank paid in 2016.\n\nYet Huang will have to stretch to earn a return on Nvidia\u2019s minimum investment of $35 billion, including the stock granted to Arm employees. Nvidia is betting that the considerable investment made by SoftBank into Arm\u2019s operations will help profit ramp up quickly. Even so, on the last fiscal year\u2019s roughly $1.8 billion in sales, Arm made an operating loss. For Nvidia to bag, say, a 10% return, the target will have to generate a massive $4.4 billion in operating profit, assuming a 21% U.S. corporate tax rate, according to a Breakingviews calculation.\n\nGrowth will depend on winning over many of Arm\u2019s customers like Intel, which compete with Nvidia, as well as anti-trust regulators around the world. And appeasing politicians will further squeeze returns: Nvidia has pledged to expand Arm\u2019s UK operations as lawmakers there worry about a loss of jobs. Huang\u2019s designs on the chip industry will be tested.\n\nThis article has been corrected to show SoftBank paid $32 billion for Arm, and that the sum from Nvidia deal represents a decent increase in the third paragraph.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:37.543120", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 08:30:25+00:00", "publish_time": "08:30:25", "source": "reuters", "title": "Breakingviews - Nvidia's $40 bln Arm deal is risky chess move", "topics": ["chess", "worth", "nvidia", "billion", "bln", "risky", "arm", "40", "customers", "nvidias", "market", "arms", "deal", "breakingviews", "softbank"]}
