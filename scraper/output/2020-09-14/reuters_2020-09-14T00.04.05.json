{"authors": ["Echo Wang", "Greg Roumeliotis"], "body": "(Reuters) - Oracle Corp said on Monday it would team up with China\u2019s ByteDance to keep TikTok operating in the United States, beating Microsoft Corp in a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale.\n\nByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based owner, had been in talks to divest the U.S. business of its hugely popular short-video app to Oracle or Microsoft after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the sale last month and said he might otherwise shut it down.\n\nWhile TikTok is best known for dancing videos that go viral among teenagers, U.S. officials are concerned user information could be passed to China\u2019s Communist Party government. TikTok, which has as many as 100 million U.S. users, has said it would never share such data with Chinese authorities.\n\nSale negotiations were upended when China updated its export control rules last month, giving it a say over the transfer of TikTok\u2019s algorithm to a foreign buyer. Reuters reported last week that China would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than allow a forced sale.\n\nOracle said it was part of a proposal submitted by ByteDance to the U.S. Treasury Department over the weekend in which Oracle would serve as TikTok\u2019s \u201ctrusted technology provider.\u201d Oracle shares were up 6.3%.\n\nUnder ByteDance\u2019s latest proposal, Oracle would assume management of TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data, sources told Reuters on Sunday. Oracle is also negotiating taking a stake in TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations, the sources added. The TikTok user data is currently stored in Alphabet Inc\u2019s cloud, with a backup in Singapore.\n\nSome of ByteDance\u2019s top investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, will also be given minority stakes in those operations, one of the sources said.\n\nPRECEDENT\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump, who wants a U.S. technology firm to own most of TikTok in the United States, will approve the deal. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday the administration would review it this week.\n\n\u201cI will just say from our standpoint, we\u2019ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans\u2019 data is secure, that the phones are secure and we\u2019ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams,\u201d he said.\n\nMnuchin said the deadline to approve a deal was Sept. 20 and that the current proposal included a commitment to create a U.S.-headquartered company with 20,000 new jobs.\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for national security risk, is overseeing the ByteDance-Oracle talks, and Mnuchin said there would also be a separate national security review by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cUser data protection and assurances around how the company\u2019s algorithms push content to U.S. users are thoughtful components of a substantive solution, but whether they can change political outcomes is a much more difficult question,\u201d said regulatory lawyer John Kabealo, who is not involved in the talks.\n\nByteDance plans to argue that CFIUS\u2019 approval two years ago of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd\u2019s purchase of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc offers a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, the sources said.\n\nIn that deal, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based, third-party service to manage Genworth\u2019s U.S. policyholder data. ByteDance will argue a similar arrangement with Oracle can safeguard TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data, the sources said.\n\nByteDance and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment on Monday when asked at a press conference about the TikTok deal, but said TikTok was being \u201cencircled\u201d and \u201ccoerced\u201d in the United States into a transaction.\n\nA smartphone with the Tik Tok logo is seen in front of a displayed Oracle logo in this illustration taken, Septemeber 14, 2020.

His firm has significant technological prowess in handling and safeguarding data, but no social media experience as its clientele comprises companies, rather than consumers.\n\nPeking University professor of investment Jeffrey Towson said Oracle\u2019s ownership of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations with access, but not ownership, of ByteDance\u2019s core technology mirrored how many Western companies operate in China.\n\nOn Sunday, Microsoft said it had been informed by ByteDance that the Chinese firm would not be selling it TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. Walmart Inc, which had joined Microsoft\u2019s bid, said it was still interested in investing, and that it would talk further with ByteDance and other parties.\n\n\u201cThis is bad news for Walmart more than anyone else,\u201d said Towson. \u201cCombining TikTok\u2019s entertainment and user engagement with its e-commerce platform was its best shot at catching up\u201d with Amazon.com Inc.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S ORDERS\n\nAs Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, cybersecurity and the spread of the coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint.\n\nAs many as 40% of Americans back Trump\u2019s threat to ban TikTok if it is not sold to a U.S. buyer, a Reuters/Ipsos national poll found last month. Among Republicans - Trump\u2019s party - 69% said they supported the order, though only 32% expressed familiarity with the app.\n\nThe White House has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems \u201cuntrusted\u201d Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order prohibiting transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd\u2019s messenger app WeChat.\n\nEarlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold gay dating app Grindr, bought in 2016, for $620 million after CFIUS ordered its divestment.\n\nByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly - whose user base was largely American - for $1 billion in 2017 without seeking CFIUS approval, relaunching it as TikTok the following year. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS was investigating TikTok.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:37.253248", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 00:04:05+00:00", "publish_time": "00:04:05", "source": "reuters", "title": "ByteDance picks Oracle as partner to try to save TikTok U.S.", "topics": ["tiktoks", "user", "data", "states", "tiktok", "bytedance", "trump", "sources", "oracle", "united", "picks", "partner", "try", "deal", "save"]}
