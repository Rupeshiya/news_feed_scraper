Stefan Rousseau/Pool via REUTERS\n\nThe European Union says Johnson\u2019s plan would wreck trade talks and propel the United Kingdom towards a messy Brexit while former British leaders have warned that breaking the law is a step too far that will tarnish the country\u2019s image.\n\nThe House of Commons is due to vote on moving the Internal Market Bill, which the EU has demanded London scrap by the end of the month, to its next amendment stage after a debate that Johnson will introduce.\n\nAs Johnson prepared to try to persuade lawmakers that his plan to explicitly break international law was worth supporting, a derivatives industry source said the European Commission had delayed a decision on euro clearing.\n\nJohnson, who has a majority of 80 in the lower house of parliament, faces a growing revolt. All of Britain\u2019s living former prime ministers have expressed concern about his plan as have many senior figures in his Conservative Party.\n\n\u201cNo British minister should solemnly undertake to observe treaty obligations with his fingers crossed behind his back,\u201d Johnson\u2019s former Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is influential with colleagues, said in The Times newspaper.\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, who was self isolating due to coronavirus, said he would oppose a bill that broke international law.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan to explicitly break international law has plunged Brexit back into crisis less than four months before Britain is finally due to leave the EU\u2019s orbit at the end of a transition period, and jeopardised trade talks.\n\nThe EU has ramped up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, which would be chaotic for business, markets and nearly $1 trillion (775.92 billion pounds) in annual trade.\n\nWHO BLINKS FIRST?\n\nConservative lawmaker Rehman Chishti, who was Johnson\u2019s special envoy for freedom of religion, quit his role, saying he could not support the bill. \u201cAs an MP (lawmaker) for 10yrs & former barrister, values of respecting rule of law & honouring one\u2019s word are dear to me,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBritish ministers say the bill, which explicitly states that it could be inconsistent with a host of international laws, is intended to clarify ambiguities - particularly over Northern Ireland - and act as a safeguard in case trade talks fall.\n\nBut some EU diplomats believe London is playing a game of chicken, inviting the collapse of trade talks to either get the deal it wants or leave without a deal.\n\nThe EU says it cannot trust those who break agreements and that if the bill is not effectively scrapped there will be no trade deal to cover everything from car parts to food.\n\nIf, as expected, it is passed in its second reading on Monday, there will be four more days of debate on the bill\u2019s fine print - lasting into Tuesday of next week.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:02.630440", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 05:48:19+00:00", "publish_time": "05:48:19", "source": "reuters", "title": "EU plays the money card as Johnson faces Brexit revolt in parliament", "topics": ["international", "parliament", "law", "talks", "plan", "johnson", "london", "trade", "plays", "card", "revolt", "money", "brexit", "bill", "eu", "faces"]}
