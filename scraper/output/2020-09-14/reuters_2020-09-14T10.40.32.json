The ship had left long trails of marine oil slicks.\n\nHe said the Sri Lankan Navy and Indian Coast Guard divers on Sunday inspected the vessels and surrounding area for any further leak.\n\nA team of officials from Sri Lanka\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) visited the tanker on Monday to inspect and collect samples of marine fuel oil from the vessel loaded with about 2 million barrels of oil.\n\nMEPA has said it plans to take action against the ship\u2019s owner under the country\u2019s laws to protect the marine ecosystem.\n\nIndian Oil Corp, which has chartered the ship to import oil to Paradip in eastern India from Kuwait, is waiting for a salvagers\u2019 report expected within a week, its chairman S.M. Vaidya said.\n\n\u201cWe will be looking at salvors\u2019 recommendation as to which is the nearest port they can tow the vessel to for ship-to-ship transfer of the oil cargo,\u201d Vaidya told Reuters.\n\nHe said normally ship-to-ship transfer of the cargo doesn\u2019t happen in high seas due to rough weather conditions.\n\nEventually the crude will be taken to Pardip refinery for processing, he added.\n\nDe Silva said seven tug boats were engaged to keep a vigil on the vessel and provide support to the salvagers carrying out the repair work.\n\nNew Shipping Ltd, the manager of the Panama-flagged New Diamond, has appointed SMIT Singapore Pte Ltd to lead salvage operations.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:20.945730", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 10:40:32+00:00", "publish_time": "10:40:32", "source": "reuters", "title": "Salvagers mend ruptures in fire-hit oil tanker off Sri Lanka", "topics": ["repair", "transfer", "vessel", "salvagers", "mend", "lanka", "navy", "sri", "oil", "firehit", "marine", "silva", "vaidya", "ruptures", "told", "tanker"]}
