{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece has resettled hundreds of migrants in a temporary new tent facility after a fire destroyed their overcrowded refugee camp on the island of Lesbos and hopes to have moved all of them this week, government officials said on Monday.\n\nMore than 12,000 people, mostly refugees from Afghanistan, Africa and Syria, are without shelter and are having to sleep out in the open without proper sanitation after the fire tore through the Moria migrant camp last Wednesday.\n\nGreece is now registering the migrants and testing them for the COVID-19 disease before channeling them into the temporary tent camp, government spokesman Stelios Petsas said, though a police officer said some were refusing to move to the facility.\n\n\u201cWe expect that in the next three to four days all will be housed, a bit less than the (total number of) roughly 12,000 homeless,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAuthorities have already moved some 400 minors from the island to the Greek mainland since the blaze for possible resettlement in other European countries.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nAbout 600 migrants have so far been resettled in the temporary tent camp and 14 of them have tested positive for COVID-19, a government official said.\n\nIn the chaos following last week\u2019s fire, authorities lost sight of 35 people who had tested positive, deepening fears of an outbreak among migrants sleeping closely together without proper sanitation.\n\nPetsas repeated on Monday the government\u2019s suspicion that the fire was started deliberately \u201cby migrants who wanted to blackmail the government to leave the island\u201d. An investigation into the cause of the blaze is continuing.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday that Greece would build a permanent new migrant reception centre to replace the Moria facility.\n\nGermany\u2019s Bild newspaper reported on Monday that Berlin is considering taking in thousands of refugees from Lesbos as a one-off gesture and also wants the Moria camp to be rebuilt and run by the European Union.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:30.630154", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 12:39:53+00:00", "publish_time": "12:39:53", "source": "reuters", "title": "Greece resettling stranded migrants to tent camp on Lesbos", "topics": ["resettled", "stranded", "tested", "temporary", "refugees", "island", "greece", "proper", "tent", "resettling", "lesbos", "camp", "migrants", "moria"]}
