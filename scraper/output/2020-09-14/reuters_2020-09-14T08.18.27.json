REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\n\nRusesabagina, who once called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video, appeared in a Kigali court accused of terrorism, complicity in murder and forming or joining an irregular armed group, among other charges.\n\nHis trial promises to be the most high-profile yet in a string of cases against Kagame\u2019s opponents.\n\nBrought to court handcuffed in a van inscribed \u201cRIB\u201d for Rwanda Investigation Bureau, the 66-year-old Rusesabagina wore a tan suit and an anti-coronavirus mask. He sat pensively before responding.\n\nHe told the court that he had contributed 20,000 euros ($24,000) to the National Liberation Front (FLN), the military wing of the Mouvement Rwandais pour le Changement D\u00e9mocratique, which he co-chairs.\n\n\u201cFLN killed people,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIf there are bad acts that were done against the people, I regret that and I ask forgiveness to the families of victims.\u201d\n\nRusesabagina refused to enter a plea for any of the charges. He was due to appear again on Thursday to apply for bail.\n\nHOLLYWOOD MOVIE\n\nThe Oscar-nominated film \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d portrayed Rusesabagina, a former hotel manager, using his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter.\n\nAfter the genocide, Rusesabagina acquired Belgian citizenship and became resident of the United States. He became a vocal critic of Kagame, whom he accused of stifling opposition, an accusation the government denies.\n\nRusesabagina has not been allowed to meet lawyers appointed by his family, they said in a statement. But one of his government-appointed lawyers, David Rugaza, argued he was on trial for exercising freedom of speech.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\n\u201cHe got a Belgian citizenship in 1999,\u201d Rugaza told the one-judge hearing. \u201cRwanda is trying a foreign citizen (for) freedom of expression that he enjoyed while abroad.\u201d\n\nSome in Rwanda, including Kagame, have accused Rusesabagina of exaggerating his heroism, which he denies.\n\nIt is still unclear how Rusesabagina came to be in Rwanda. His family say he was disappeared from Dubai.\n\nThe court struck out a defence objection that the arrest was irregular, ruling that it had jurisdiction because Rusesabagina was arrested in Rwandan territory, without providing further details.\n\nJUSTICE SYSTEM UNDER SCRUTINY\n\nKagame has ruled Rwanda since the end of the genocide and won the last elections - in 2017 - with nearly 99% of the vote.\n\nHe has enjoyed widespread credit and support from Western donors for restoring Rwanda to stability, cracking down on corruption and boosting economic growth in the East African nation of 12 million.\n\nBut international rights groups and political opponents say his rule is increasingly tainted by repression.\n\n\u201cKagame and other government officials regularly threaten those who criticize the government,\u201d Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a briefing note, adding that the judiciary lacked independence and torture of prisoners was common.\n\nThe government denies accusations of torture of detainees.\n\nTibor Nagy, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, tweeted earlier this month that the United States wanted to see Rusesabagina receive a \u201cfair trial\u201d.\n\nMichaela Wrong, a British author researching a book about Rwandan politics, said the trial was already putting the Kagame government under greater scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe Rwandan government\u2019s traditional supporters may well start asking themselves why so many opposition activists disappear and meet violent ends in Rwanda, why so many human rights activists and journalists flee abroad,\u201d she said.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:09.796870", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 08:18:27+00:00", "publish_time": "08:18:27", "source": "reuters", "title": "'Hotel Rwanda' hero declines to plead to terrorism charges", "topics": ["declines", "charges", "portrayed", "hotel", "court", "trial", "rights", "rwandan", "terrorism", "kigali", "rwanda", "rugaza", "plead", "genocide", "rusesabagina", "hero"]}
