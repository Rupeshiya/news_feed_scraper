{"authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "body": "(Reuters) - World number one Novak Djokovic says he cannot guarantee he will not make a similar mistake that led to his disqualification at the U.S. Open for striking a line judge with a ball but he remains confident it will not affect his tennis in the future.\n\nSep 6, 2020; Flushing Meadows, New York, USA; Novak Djokovic of Serbia and a tournament official tend to a linesperson who was struck with a ball by Djokovic against Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain (not pictured) on day seven of the 2020 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nThe Serb was disqualified in the fourth round in New York when he hit a ball in frustration after dropping serve in the first set against Spain\u2019s Pablo Carreno Busta, hitting line judge Laura Clark in her throat and causing her to fall to the floor.\n\nDjokovic, who had already apologised for the incident, said that he called on the lineswoman to check on her health since the incident at Flushing Meadows.\n\n\u201cI cannot promise or cannot guarantee that I will never ever do anything similar to that in my life,\u201d Djokovic told a news conference at the Italian Open on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the best version of myself on the court and off the court and I understand that I have outbursts and this is kind of the personality and the player that I have always been.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take this in as profound as possible for me as a big lesson.\u201d\n\nFollowing the incident, the tournament organisers confirmed Djokovic was fined $250,000 -- his prize money for reaching round four. The 33-year-old was also fined an additional $10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of speculation about whether it was deserved. I accepted it, I moved on,\u201d Djokovic added. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t forget about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget about it.\u201d\n\nIn Djokovic\u2019s absence, Austria\u2019s second-seeded Dominic Thiem claimed his maiden Grand Slam title in New York after he came back from two sets down to beat German Alexander Zverev in the final on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI watched the final last night until the end of the fourth set. You know, I want to congratulate both of these guys,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\n\u201cFor Dominic to lose three (slam) finals and start the match not on a very high level but then come back and win in such fashion is very inspiring.\u201d\n\nFRENCH OPEN CHALLENGE\n\nThe disqualification, however, gave Djokovic more time to regroup before his claycourt opener at this week\u2019s Italian Open -- a tune-up for the French Open starting Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great I have a tournament a week or 10 days after it happened because I feel the earlier I get back in competition mode the faster I\u2019ll overcome the memory and reprogramme it. I\u2019m hoping for the best,\u201d said the 17-times Grand Slam winner.\n\nRafa Nadal, bidding for a record-extending 13th French Open title, is returning after more than six months on Tour having skipped the U.S. Open due to COVID-19 concerns.\n\n\u201cFor the guys who are playing U.S. Open, it\u2019s very close, very tight after an exhausting month of tennis in the States on different surfaces,\u201d said Djokovic. \u201cRafa obviously decided to stay on clay and practice.\n\n\u201cI mean, surely that gives him more advantage, but even if he didn\u2019t practice for that long on clay, he would still be the number one favourite in Roland Garros or any other clay tournament... he\u2019s the ultimate challenge.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:36.803067", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 12:14:53+00:00", "publish_time": "12:14:53", "source": "reuters", "title": "'A big lesson': Djokovic ready to move on from U.S. Open default", "topics": ["york", "slam", "clay", "incident", "title", "lesson", "open", "tennis", "ready", "default", "djokovic", "tournament", "big", "ball"]}
