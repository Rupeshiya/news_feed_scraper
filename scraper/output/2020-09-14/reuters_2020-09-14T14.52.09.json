REUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\nFacebook had sought a judicial review of the Irish Data Protection Commission\u2019s preliminary decision that the mechanism it used to transfer data from the European Union to the United States \u201ccannot in practice be used.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave to take the Judicial Review was granted,\u201d the court spokesman said.\n\n\u201cA stay was put on the Section 11 order,\u201d he added, referring to the Data Protection Commission order that threatened to block the data flows. No date has yet been set for the matter to return to the court, he said.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman welcomed the court decision. \u201cBusinesses need clear, global rules, underpinned by the strong rule of law, to protect transatlantic data flows over the long term,\u201d she said.\n\nIn seeking to derail the Irish regulator\u2019s decision, Facebook has said the mechanism in question, the Standard Contractual Clause (SCC), had been deemed valid by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July.\n\nHowever, the July ruling also said that under SCCs, privacy watchdogs must suspend or prohibit transfers outside the EU if data protection in other countries cannot be assured.\n\nThe transatlantic argument stems from EU concerns that the surveillance regime in the United States may not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the United States for commercial use.\n\nStandard Contractual Clause are used by thousands of companies to transfer Europeans\u2019 data around the world and a ban could cause widespread disruption to transatlantic data services.\n\nMax Schrems, the data privacy activist who is a party in the case, said that Facebook had argued it needed more time to respond and that it would be unfair that the Irish regulator was only targeting Facebook and not other tech companies.\n\nA Data Protection Commission spokesman declined to comment.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:47.662855", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 14:52:09+00:00", "publish_time": "14:52:09", "source": "reuters", "title": "Irish High court freezes probe into Facebook's EU-U.S. data flows", "topics": ["states", "facebook", "data", "freezes", "probe", "euus", "spokesman", "court", "protection", "privacy", "irish", "flows", "union", "transatlantic", "facebooks", "high", "united"]}
