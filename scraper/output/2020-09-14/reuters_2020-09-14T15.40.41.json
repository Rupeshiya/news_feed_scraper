Over the next three days rival oil majors will be tuning in to hear the BP chief executive set out how the company\u2019s pivot to renewable energy is going to work. The answer may not be totally reassuring: while credible, Looney\u2019s plan resembles a high-wire balancing act.\n\nThe initial direction of travel, set out on Aug. 4, showed BP\u2019s rivals a clean pair of heels. Looney\u2019s pledge to cut 2030 oil production by 40% and drive a 10-fold increase in investment in low-carbon energy was ample proof of his desire for BP to become an \u201cintegrated energy company\u201d. Moreover, the headline numbers suggest he can fund the transition.\n\nBank of America analysts reckon BP can generate $109 billion of operating cash flow in the five years to 2025. That\u2019s more than enough for the $22 billion cumulative cost of a 5.25 cents-a-quarter dividend, $9 billion to reduce net debt below Looney\u2019s $35 billion target, and $75 billion of capital investment. With a third of the latter used for wind and solar energy, BP\u2019s renewables budget could be $50 billion over the next decade. Given new projects may also carry their own debt, that could plausibly be enough to fund the $110 billion Jefferies reckons would get the group\u2019s renewables generating capacity to a 2030 target of 50 gigawatts.\n\nThe catch is that BofA\u2019s estimates assume the price of oil is $55 a barrel, rather than the current level under $40. So do Looney\u2019s ambitions to make a 12%-14% return on average capital employed. If oil undershoots, BP could find it harder to pay dividends and keep up investment.\n\nBP shareholders have a dividend airbag of sorts: $15 billion in extra hydrocarbon asset sales by 2025. Still, August\u2019s cut means shareholder payouts look spartan against rival Exxon Mobil\u2019s unimpaired dividend.\n\nThe wider issue for Looney\u2019s investors, though, is how his new stock of renewables projects performs. In theory, such assets should last longer than oil fields, potentially rewarding BP with a lower cost of capital. However, its status as a forced buyer could lead him to overpay, while Danish wind operator Orsted recently cited the risk of greater renewables capacity hitting power prices. Looney is on the right track, but it\u2019s a dicey one.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:37.440726", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 15:40:41+00:00", "publish_time": "15:40:41", "source": "reuters", "title": "Breakingviews - BP limbers up for green transition high-wire act", "topics": ["target", "billion", "looneys", "green", "set", "bp", "limbers", "act", "oil", "capital", "wind", "energy", "renewables", "transition", "breakingviews", "highwire"]}
