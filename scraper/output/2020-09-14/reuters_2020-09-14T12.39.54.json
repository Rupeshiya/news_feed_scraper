{"authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly"], "body": "(Reuters) - Dominic Thiem ended a six-year wait for a new name on a men\u2019s Grand Slam trophy on Sunday with his U.S. Open triumph but it was not just Alexander Zverev that the Austrian had to battle on court to fulfil his \u201clife goal\u201d.\n\nSep 13 2020; Flushing Meadows, New York, USA; Alexander Zverev of Germany (L) and Dominic Thiem of Austria (R) pose with the finalist and championship trophies (respectively) after their match in the men's singles final match on day fourteen of the 2020 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRafa Nadal had denied Thiem the French Open trophy at the previous two editions of that tournament, while at the start of 2020 it was world number one Novak Djokovic who outlasted him in the Australian Open title clash.\n\nThiem did not have to go through Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer, the sport\u2019s \u2018Big Three\u2019, during the two weeks at Flushing Meadows this year but that presented a unique mental challenge as the 27-year-old wrestled with long-time friend Zverev, 23, for success in his fourth Slam final.\n\n\u201cWe both didn\u2019t face one of the \u2018Big Three\u2019, so I guess that was in the back of the head for both of us,\u201d Thiem told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were nervous. (It) was a very good chance for the both of us.\u201d\n\nThe experience of playing three Grand Slam finals previously was supposed to be an advantage for the Austrian against an opponent who was featuring in his first final at a major.\n\nBut it proved to be a burden for Thiem, who found himself two sets and a break down against the big-serving German before fighting back to win 2-6 4-6 6-4 6-3 7-6(6).\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think it didn\u2019t help me at all because I was so tight in the beginning. Maybe it was not even good that I played in previous major finals,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI mean, I wanted this title so much, and of course there was also in my head that if I lose this one, it\u2019s 0-4. It\u2019s always in your head.\n\n\u201cIs this chance ever coming back again? This, that, all these thoughts, which are not great to play your best tennis, to play free. That\u2019s what exactly happened in the beginning.\u201d\n\nBut Thiem managed to quell those doubts and levelled things against Zverev before winning a nerve-jangling final set tiebreak to achieve \u201ca life goal, a dream\u201d.\n\nThiem hopes to play more freely with fewer nerves in future, having finally tasted success at one of the sport\u2019s biggest stages while also becoming the first man since Croat Marin Cilic won the 2014 U.S. Open to secure a maiden Grand Slam trophy.\n\nHe is also the first player born in the 1990s to claim a men\u2019s Grand Slam, and the first outside Nadal and Federer, who both missed the tournament, and Djokovic, who was disqualified, to win a major since Stan Wawrinka\u2019s 2016 U.S. Open triumph.\n\nCHARTING OWN PATH\n\nThiem will now face heavier expectations in future Grand Slams but has proved he is not one to shy away from pressure.\n\nThe Austrian, who faced his share of criticism for playing in Djokovic\u2019s ill-fated Adria Tour event, declined to contribute to an emergency fund for financially struggling lower-ranked professionals during the COVID-19 shutdown, fully aware that he would draw flak from pundits and fellow players for his stand.\n\nThiem, who has earned almost $27 million in career prize money, stood his ground in the face of criticism, proving that he was ready to chart his own path forward.\n\nMost of Thiem\u2019s early success came on claycourts, where long baseline rallies test a player\u2019s patience and endurance, but he showed the first signs of a smooth transition to hardcourts when he won last year\u2019s ATP Masters at Indian Wells.\n\nReaching the season-ending ATP Finals further underlined his development while he put any lingering doubts about his hardcourt prowess to rest by progressing to the Australian Open final in Melbourne earlier this year.\n\n\u201cBefore I started to work with him, when I saw him like a spectator, I said he can play everywhere, not only on clay,\u201d his coach Nicolas Massu said.\n\n\u201cHe can have the same results on every surface because the game, the shots, he\u2019s talented, he has everything. Maybe he needs to adjust small things.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:36.860552", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 12:39:54+00:00", "publish_time": "12:39:54", "source": "reuters", "title": "Thiem tames 'Big Match' nerves to break Grand Slam barrier", "topics": ["slam", "barrier", "final", "tournament", "zverev", "open", "tennis", "success", "play", "match", "break", "tames", "grand", "nerves", "thiem", "big"]}
