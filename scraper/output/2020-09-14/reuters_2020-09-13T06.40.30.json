{"authors": ["Allison Lampert"], "body": "MONTREAL (Reuters) - As COVID-19 grounds swaths of airline fleets, companies that profit off the dismantling and trade of aircraft parts are seeing early signs of an expected rebound in activity as carriers accelerate plane retirements.\n\nWhile companies that store, dismantle, and buy and sell used aircraft parts see opportunity in parked planes, a sudden increase in the supply of used parts risks depressing prices in the estimated $3 billion a year industry, despite demand from airlines seeking to lower maintenance costs, executives and analysts say.\n\nEven as aviation remains in a slump because of the pandemic, the head of U.S. commercial aerospace company GA Telesis was made aware of five airlines calling for offers to dismantle planes.\n\nAcross the border, Canada\u2019s Aerocycle is bidding to buy grounded planes for the first time to dismantle and resell for parts, instead of just recycling aircraft on consignment from carriers, its CEO said.\n\nThe fate of the world\u2019s pool of grounded planes is being closely watched by players in the market for used-serviceable material, with one report from consultants Oliver Wyman forecasting \u201ca tsunami of demand\u201d for such parts, as airlines seek to lower costs.\n\nUsed materials could compete with new parts and defer immediate airline demand for \u201caftermarket\u201d spend, referring to the maintenance, repair and overhaul sector, now estimated by Naveo Consultancy at $50 billion.\n\nAs a result, one industry executive said he has avoided buying parts, fearing a slump if too many planes are dismantled.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a rapid decrease in pricing,\u201d said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe number of planes dismantled for parts or scrap could double to 1,000 annually through 2023, up from roughly 400 to 500 planes a year since 2016, according to data firm Cirium.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nNaveo estimates 60% of global passenger and cargo fleets are currently flying.\n\nIn 2020, Naveo expects 2,000 aircraft will be retired, or parked and not returned to service, up from 680 in 2019. But those planes would not all be immediately dismantled, as some carriers wait in case market conditions improve, Managing Director Richard Brown says.\n\nIndeed, UK-based Air Salvage International, which normally dismantles between 40 and 50 aircraft a year, has parked more planes without a buyer for their parts since the COVID-19 outbreak. Founder Mark Gregory expects most will eventually be dismantled.\n\nBefore the pandemic, planes arrived at Air Salvage with a buyer, reflecting healthy demand for coveted parts like engines.\n\nAirlines seek viable used parts from retired aircraft for their younger planes that are due for heavy maintenance. That allowed airlines to avoid costly repairs and keep their aircraft flying.\n\nGA Telesis, which counts Tokyo Century Corp 8439.T as its largest shareholder, has seen airlines use spare parts from their grounded aircraft to put off maintenance at the company's repair business, chief executive Abdol Moabery said.\n\nEARLY RETIREMENTS\n\nThe pandemic, which is expected result in a 55% drop in 2020 passenger numbers, has prompted early retirements of older planes, including the grounding of B747 jets by British Airways, some of which are headed to Air Salvage.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nFewer twin-aisle planes flying internationally means less demand for their parts, with the exception of certain aircraft used to transport cargo.\n\nGregory said Air Salvage was approached by an aircraft leasing company about dismantling several A380s, but with only about 5% of the jumbo jets still active according to Naveo, demand is slim for their parts.\n\nAirlines are looking for narrowbody parts, since around 64% of that single-aisle aircraft type are active, flying domestic routes.\n\nJames Benfield, a UK partner with Baird Capital, expects increased demand for disassembly services for single-aisle B737 and A320 aircraft, after the private equity company acquired a disassembler in August.\n\nWhile maintenance companies and new engine producers also deal in used materials, a parts surplus could weigh on their sales.\n\nGeneral Electric Co's GE.N CEO said during a July earnings call that the company is \"well positioned to participate\" in the industry trend for used serviceable material.\n\nGE Aviation makes engines, but also uses second-hand parts.\n\nBARGAIN HUNTERS\n\nAerocycle sees opportunity in plane retirements. The small aircraft recycler has hired a new business development executive to drive demand, as it looks to buy planes, CEO Ron Haber said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a calculated risk,\u201d Haber said. \u201cWe know what type of aircraft are going to be flying and still in high demand.\u201d\n\nAirlines have avoided selling aircraft at losses, despite pressure from certain bargain-hunters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of low-balling going on,\u201d Moabery said. \u201cBut those offers aren\u2019t being accepted yet.\u201d\n\nCompanies like Florida-based International Aircraft Associates (IAA) are watching in case airlines and lessors cut their losses by year\u2019s end and convert their parked planes for parts.\n\n\u201cIf they do that, that\u2019s when people like us want to be ready,\u201d IAA President Mitch Weinberg said.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:45.876336", "publish_date": "2020-09-13", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-13 06:40:30+00:00", "publish_time": "06:40:30", "source": "reuters", "title": "With airline fleets grounded, plane recyclers bet on parts boom", "topics": ["airline", "parts", "airlines", "grounded", "maintenance", "recyclers", "aircraft", "planes", "fleets", "boom", "parked", "naveo", "executive", "bet", "demand", "used", "plane"]}
