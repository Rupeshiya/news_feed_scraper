{"authors": ["Bart Biesemans", "Clement Rossignol"], "body": "VERVIERS (Reuters) - For years it was just an urban myth. Then the diggers moved in and found it was true - that the heart of a former mayor of the eastern Belgian city of Verviers really was buried under a fountain.\n\nA small metal box, containing Pierre David\u2019s heart in an ethanol-filled jar, was uncovered during renovation work on the city\u2019s ornate stone fountain last month.\n\nThe relic is mentioned in civic documents, but until it was found \u201cno one really believed it,\u201d Verviers city councillor Maxime Degey told Reuters.\n\n\u201cToday the legend is no longer a legend. It\u2019s a reality.\u201d\n\nDavid, the city\u2019s first mayor after Belgium became an independent country, was still in office when he died in 1839 after falling from a building.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nAuthorities built a fountain in his honour and, with his family\u2019s permission, placed his heart under a stone in the monument in 1883.\n\nThe box is on display at the Verviers Museum of Fine Arts and Ceramics. It will be returned to the Fontaine David in the city\u2019s Place Verte once the renovation is complete.\n\n\u201cI do not know of any other example of a mayor whose heart has been preserved in a monument ... in the middle of his town. That\u2019s unique,\u201d said Nathalie Weerts, the museum\u2019s deputy curator.\n\nDavid first served as mayor of Verviers from 1800-1808, when Belgium was under French rule. His second stint in office began in 1830, the year that Belgium became an independent country.\n\nHe established the city\u2019s first fire brigade and opened up politics, letting the public in to watch city council debates.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:30.921457", "publish_date": "2020-09-10", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-10 12:55:47+00:00", "publish_time": "12:55:47", "source": "reuters", "title": "Belgian city finds its former mayor's heart in a fountain", "topics": ["stone", "city", "finds", "office", "fountain", "really", "citys", "mayors", "belgian", "belgium", "verviers", "heart", "renovation", "mayor"]}
