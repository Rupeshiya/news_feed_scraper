{"authors": ["Helen Coster"], "body": "(Reuters) - Oracle Corp said on Monday it would team up with China\u2019s ByteDance to keep TikTok operating in the United States, beating Microsoft Corp in a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale.\n\nGetting the transaction across the finish line will rest heavily on Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison, one of the few top technology executives to openly support President Donald Trump, who has ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok amid concerns over the safety of the personal data of U.S. consumers.\n\nKey moments:\n\nDecember 2016: Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz joined then president-elect Trump\u2019s transition team, and remained at the company in the process.\n\nFebruary 2020: Ellison hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his Rancho Mirage, California, estate, according to the Desert Sun. Guests could pay $100,000 to join a golf outing and have their photo taken with the president; for $250,000, they could also participate in a round-table discussion. Oracle employees signed a Change.org petition calling for Ellison to cancel the event.\n\nMarch 2020: Ellison spoke to Trump about the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, according to the New York Times, and Oracle started to prepare to help with collecting data about the drug. Ellison offered to do the work for free, according to Forbes.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, citing federal records, Catz has donated more than $130,000 toward Trump\u2019s reelection. In 2019, Oracle gave between $500,000 and $999,999 to Trade Works for America, a group created by Republican operatives to support Trump\u2019s NAFTA replacement bill.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:47.618415", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 16:22:14+00:00", "publish_time": "16:22:14", "source": "reuters", "title": "Factbox: Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison\u2019s history of support for Trump", "topics": ["ellison", "york", "chairman", "trump", "trumps", "tiktok", "oracle", "larry", "team", "history", "ellisons", "factbox", "times", "according", "support"]}
