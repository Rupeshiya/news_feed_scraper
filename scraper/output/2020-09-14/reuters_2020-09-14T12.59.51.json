{"authors": ["Jill Serjeant"], "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - From \u201cInsecure\u201ds 20-something women to the Muslim-American star of \u201cRamy,\u201d Sunday\u2019s Emmy line-up is an unprecedented showcase for people of color.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nBut the television industry needs to take concrete action on pledges to nurture non-white writers and directors to ensure that the 2020 awards ceremony is not just a blip triggered by a summer of protests over systemic racism in the United States, observers say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the last thing the Television Academy wanted was to have an \u2018Emmys so white\u2019 controversy in the middle of all that,\u201d said Eric Deggans, TV critic for National Public Radio. \u201cSo I\u2019m not surprised they paid special attention to the work of Black performers,\u201d said Deggans, author of the 2012 book \u201cRace Baiter.\u201d\n\nRecord Emmy nominations for people of color included nods for Kerry Washington (\u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d and \u201cAmerican Son\u201d), Sandra Oh (\u201cKilling Eve\u201d), Billy Porter (\u201cPose\u201d), Regina King (\u201cWatchmen\u201d), Issa Rae (\u201cInsecure\u201d) and Sterling K. Brown (\u201cThis is Us\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d).\n\n\u201cWatchmen,\u201d the superhero alternative reality drama infused with racial themes, led nominations with 26 nods.\n\nNominations open doors for other Blacks, Asians and Latinos and shape perceptions beyond the world of entertainment, said Rashad Robinson, president of social justice organization Color of Change.\n\n\u201cWhat these awards represent is the industry\u2019s way of creating a system of letting people in, of creating access to jobs and opportunities,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt dictates the stories we get to see in the world about who we are, and that has deep implications on the unwritten rules about how we are treated in hospitals, by judges and at schools.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy nominees came from shows that were made before America began a painful cultural reckoning over racism this summer.\n\nMore are on their way, including documentary \u201cDriving While Black,\u201d \u201cWoke\u201d about a Black cartoonist who has an encounter with police, abolitionist drama \u201cThe Good Lord Bird,\u201d and \u201cEnslaved\u201d about the history of the slave trade.\n\nRobinson said that exciting as it is to see Black artists and stories break through, more structural changes such as inclusion riders, diversity in writers rooms and fully rounded characters are needed to ensure lasting change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to care. It\u2019s not enough to be aware,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have people willing to act and to make real changes.\u201d .\n\nDeggans noted that Latinx talent is still largely overlooked at the Emmys, even though Latinos form America\u2019s second largest ethnic group after whites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that so much of the recognition fell on Black performers and there wasn\u2019t a little bit more in regard to Latinx people especially,\u201d said Deggans, noting that shows like \u201cGentefied,\u201d \u201cVida\u201d and \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d were largely overlooked.\n\n\u201cThe cause of Latinx representation in Hollywood is a little further back - where Black people were, say, 10 years ago,\u201d Deggans added.\n\nThe Emmy Awards will be handed out on Sunday at a virtual ceremony televised on ABC.\n\n(The story corrects nominations for Sterling K.
