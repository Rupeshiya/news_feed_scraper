{"authors": ["Jeff Mason"], "body": "HENDERSON, Nev. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump held a Nevada campaign rally at an indoor venue on Sunday despite public health professionals\u2019 warnings against large indoor gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump, a Republican, railed against his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, suggesting he was taking drugs and was soft on crime.\n\n\u201cBiden wants to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists,\u201d Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd. \u201cIf Biden wins, the mob wins.\u201d\n\nPeople in the crowd were seated close together and many did not wear masks.\n\nBiden has criticized Trump for holding campaign events that put people at risk of contracting the coronavirus, which has killed more than 194,000 people in the United States.\n\nTrump played down the virus in its early stages and has alternately embraced and disregarded advice from public health experts, who encourage mask-wearing and maintaining social distance to prevent its spread.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign portrayed the rally at a large warehouse in Henderson as an opportunity for supporters to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\n\u201cIf you can join tens of thousands of people protesting in the streets, gamble in a casino, or burn down small businesses in riots, you can gather peacefully under the First Amendment to hear from the president of the United States,\u201d spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.\n\nParticipants were to have temperatures taken before entry and be given a mask they would be encouraged to wear, the campaign said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re relatively safe here. I brought a mask but I haven\u2019t felt the need to wear it,\u201d said Ronda Livingston, 64.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is trailing Biden in national polls and in Nevada, has stepped up the frequency of his rallies in recent weeks, but has held most of them at outdoor venues or in large open airplane hangars to help minimize risk.\n\nBiden has criticized Trump sharply for his response to the virus and promised a comprehensive strategy to fight the pandemic if he succeeds Trump in the White House.\n\nTrump is in the middle of a western swing that will include a campaign stop in Arizona and a visit to California on Monday to be briefed about the wildfires devastating the west coast.\n\nTrump has knocked Biden for doing fewer events and traveling less than he in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:19.648465", "publish_date": "2020-09-13", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-13 22:57:12+00:00", "publish_time": "22:57:12", "source": "reuters", "title": "Trump holds campaign rally indoors despite coronavirus concerns", "topics": ["holds", "trump", "rally", "coronavirus", "campaign", "concerns", "wear", "president", "virus", "indoors", "large", "terrorists", "biden", "united", "despite"]}
