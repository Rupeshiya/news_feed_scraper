{"authors": ["Chad Terhune"], "body": "(Reuters) - As the coronavirus pandemic spreads deeper into America\u2019s small towns and rural outposts, Dr. Tallulah Holmstrom has seen familiar faces fill her intensive-care unit in Camden, South Carolina.\n\nA native of this hamlet of 7,000 people, Holmstrom saw its ICU threatened with closure in recent years as specialists departed for bigger cities. Now faraway doctors are helping treat the community\u2019s COVID-19 patients, thanks to technology.\n\nKershawHealth, the local hospital, installed cameras and other equipment for 24-hour monitoring by a company that employs doctors and nurses remotely. Sitting in cubicles in St. Louis, Houston and Honolulu, as well as other countries including Israel and India, these medical workers watch patients\u2019 vital signs on computer screens and talk to local staff on two-way video about medications and treatments. KershawHealth employees can summon emergency help from these teleworkers by hitting a button on the wall.\n\nHolmstrom said those changes, begun four years ago, have helped her hospital better handle the current crisis. While Camden and surrounding Kershaw County have seen more than 1,600 confirmed infections and 34 deaths, the technology has enabled many of the area\u2019s COVID-19 patients to be hospitalized close to home.\n\n\u201cNow a patient can look up from their ICU bed here and they are seeing a friend\u2019s daughter or son taking care of them or someone they go to church with,\u201d said Holmstrom, chief medical officer at KershawHealth.\n\nCamden is among a growing number of communities relying on this elaborate form of telemedicine to cope with an unrelenting COVID-19 case load and to manage unpredictable surges.\n\nWell before the current crisis, vast stretches of rural America lacked easy access to advanced medical care. More than 130 rural hospitals have closed in the United States since 2010, including 18 last year, according to University of North Carolina researchers.\n\nRural areas tend to have higher rates of underlying health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Their populations often are older and poorer \u2013 making them more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nEven if beds were available, qualified staff are hard to find. It\u2019s estimated that 43 states, including South Carolina, face a shortage of highly trained ICU doctors, known as intensivists, according to researchers at George Washington University. These shortages may worsen with hospitalizations in many states predicted to peak this fall, when the coronavirus mixes with flu season, according to Patricia Pittman, director of the university\u2019s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity.\n\n\u201cNo one is suggesting telemedicine is ideal, but it\u2019s probably one of the least bad options,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is definitely better than having no one and helicoptering people out.\u201d\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nSCALING EXPERTISE\n\nAbout a third of U.S. hospitals surveyed in 2017 said they had access to a formal program of telemedicine for critically ill patients. Studies have shown telemedicine can benefit ICU patients by promoting the best practices supported by medical evidence and by reducing complications. During the pandemic, doctors say, it has helped conserve personal protective equipment and reduce workers\u2019 exposure to the virus.\n\nThere can be drawbacks, too, if physicians try to monitor too many people at once, which can lead to poor decisions or even medical errors. Tele-ICU generally requires physicians working remotely to hold a license in each state where people are hospitalized.\n\nThe Trump administration has eased rules on telehealth during the pandemic and expanded reimbursement by Medicare. Shares of telemedicine companies such as Teladoc Health Inc have soared as patients embraced online visits.\n\nSutter Health, a large hospital system in California, said it manages more than 300 ICU beds across 18 hospitals from offices in Sacramento and San Francisco.\n\nEarlier this month at its Sacramento hub, Dr. Vanessa Walker checked in remotely on a patient who was taken off a ventilator earlier in the day at Sutter\u2019s Roseville hospital about 25 miles away. Using a headset and camera, she clicked the patient\u2019s name on her screen, which rang a doorbell to notify the patient that she was entering the room via video.\n\n\u201cSave your breath. You\u2019re doing well otherwise,\u201d she told the patient.\n\nWalker, the medical director of Sutter\u2019s electronic ICU for its hospitals in California\u2019s Central Valley, had a wide array of information across six monitors at her desk. She could review medical records and see multiple scans of the patient\u2019s lungs before and after treatment.\n\nCAUTIONARY TALE\n\nAs use of this technology grows, patient-safety advocates warn hospitals not to cut corners. They say cameras and computers are no substitute for trained professionals at the bedside who can respond rapidly to life-threatening complications.\n\nThe Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit that monitors patient safety, recommends that a physician certified in critical care medicine perform an in-person review of each ICU patient daily before handing off monitoring to colleagues remotely. The group says remote doctors should lower their patient loads if they can\u2019t respond within five minutes to requests from on-site staff and evaluate the patient.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nSteve Burrows, a Los Angeles filmmaker, remains a skeptic.\n\nHe said his mother had complications during a hip operation in 2009 and suffered permanent brain damage in surgery and the ICU at a Wisconsin hospital.\n\nIn litigation, Burrows said, he learned that a doctor was remotely monitoring more than 150 ICU patients, and there was no physician in the ICU who could respond to his mother\u2019s low blood pressure. He released an HBO documentary, \u201cBleed Out,\u201d in 2018 about his mother\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cTelemedicine is fantastic if it\u2019s used properly,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I think replacing doctors at the bedside with technology is insane.\u201d\n\nAt trial, a jury found there was no negligence by the hospital. Advocate Aurora Health, the current hospital owner after a merger, said its electronic ICU \u201cdoes not replace bedside caregivers. Instead, it serves as an additional set of eyes that provides an extra layer of safety.\u201d\n\n\u2018CONSTANT ATTENTION\u2019\n\nAdvanced ICU Care, the St. Louis company serving Camden, works with more than 90 hospitals in 26 states. Overall, it has treated more than 1,300 COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cThese patients need constant attention and continuous adjustments. That is a lot of what we do,\u201d said Dr. Ram Srinivasan, the company\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nSouth Carolina remains a hot spot for coronavirus infections with more than 126,000 cases and 2,877 confirmed deaths as of September 11.\n\nThe state\u2019s first two cases of COVID-19 were announced the same day in early March and one was in Camden, a place so rural that signs remind people not to ride horses on the sidewalk.\n\nHolmstrom, the chief medical officer at KershawHealth, got a call with the news while driving home that Friday, March 6. Within a matter of days, there were six people infected and four were hospitalized.\n\nThe Camden ICU was nearly full for weeks as the medical staff juggled COVID-19 patients alongside the normal flow of critically ill people. Hospitalizations eased around Memorial Day, Holmstrom said, only to surge again in July and much of August.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a town this small and 32 people get sick in one day that\u2019s a lot,\u201d said Vic Carpenter, Kershaw County administrator.\n\nHolmstrom, who was born in the hospital where she now works, has experienced highs and lows. A close friend who spent six weeks in the hospital is now back to full strength. Holmstrom arranged final video calls for others to say goodbye to their families.\n\nKershawHealth is bracing for another surge this fall, when it once again will turn to remote doctors to back up busy hospital staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like someone constantly in the background overlooking everything with your care,\u201d Holmstrom said.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:02.095901", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 11:13:40+00:00", "publish_time": "11:13:40", "source": "reuters", "title": "Hospital ICUs lean on telemedicine amid U.S. COVID-19 crisis", "topics": ["icus", "medical", "telemedicine", "patients", "covid19", "holmstrom", "icu", "amid", "lean", "crisis", "doctors", "patient", "hospitals", "hospital"]}
