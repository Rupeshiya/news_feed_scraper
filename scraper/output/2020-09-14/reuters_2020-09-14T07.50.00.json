Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 27-year-old world number three appeared to have blown his golden chance as he fell two sets behind but hit back to become the first player to win a Grand Slam from having trailed by two sets since Gaston Gaudio at the 2004 French Open.\n\nThiem, who dropped only one set en route to the final, started as favourite but was stifled by nerves early on, trailing by a set and 5-1 as his evening threatened to become a nightmare on an eerie, almost empty Arthur Ashe stadium.\n\nHe gradually broke the shackles to hit back from a break down to take the third, however, and Zverev faltered on serve at 3-4 in a high-quality fourth set allowing Thiem to take a slow-burner of a contest to a decider.\n\nWith one of the sport\u2019s biggest prizes within reach, both men raised their games in a gripping decider.\n\nThe 23-year-old Zverev, bidding to become the first German male to win a Grand Slam since Boris Becker won in New York in 1996, showed great composure to resist the Thiem charge and served for the title at 5-3.\n\nWith the match deep into its fourth hour, though, it had become not just a physical battle but a psychological one too.\n\nFirst Zverev faltered with the title tantalisingly close, then Thiem could not hold serve for glory at 6-5 as a U.S. Open men\u2019s final moved into its first-ever fifth set tiebreak.\n\nA gut-wrenching climax saw Thiem take a 6-4 lead as Zverev\u2019s serve crumbled. But he netted a forehand with the court gaping, then sent another forehand wide.\n\nThiem earned another match point with a fearless pass though, and Zverev then dragged a backhand wide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how far our journeys brought us to share this moment and I wish -- really I wish -- we could have two winners today, I think we both deserved it,\u201d Thiem said on court after a tearful speech from his crestfallen opponent and close friend.\n\nMOMENTUM SHIFT\n\nThiem, the second Austrian to win a Grand Slam after Thomas Muster\u2019s 1995 French Open title, had lost all three of his previous Grand Slam finals.\n\nHis two French Open finals were against Rafa Nadal, a 12-times champion on the Paris clay, while at this year\u2019s Australia Open he was beaten in five stunning sets by world number one Novak Djokovic.\n\nThis time, with Nadal opting out over concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, Roger Federer injured and top seed Djokovic defaulted last Sunday for hitting a line judge with a ball, the door had swung wide open for Thiem.\n\nThings are never usually straightforward though, especially at Flushing Meadows.\n\nZverev\u2019s form had been patchy on his way to the final but he looked in fine form from the start on Sunday, bossing the baseline rallies with his smooth power.\n\nThe first set lasted 30 minutes and when Zverev went 5-1 ahead in the second a stunned Thiem was looking up forlornly at his coach Nicolas Massu.\n\nBut the Austrian began to loosen up and while he could not salvage the second set and then went a break down in the third, he was finally upping the power on his fizzing groundstrokes.\n\nWhen Zverev dropped serve to lose the third set Thiem ominously sent three rackets off to be re-strung.\n\nZverev fought off break points at 2-3 in the fourth but a double-fault and a forehand error gave Thiem the break at 3-4 and as the match went into the decider the momentum had shifted completely Thiem\u2019s way as he broke immediately.\n\nThere were to be more twists and turns before Thiem fell to his back in celebration at becoming the first player born in the 1990s to claim a men\u2019s Grand Slam, and the first outside Nadal, Djokovic and Federer to claim one since Stan Wawrinka\u2019s 2016 U.S. Open triumph.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:29.465991", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 07:50:00+00:00", "publish_time": "07:50:00", "source": "reuters", "title": "Thiem claims US Open title after thrilling fightback", "topics": ["slam", "title", "claims", "set", "final", "zverev", "open", "thrilling", "match", "fightback", "serve", "grand", "thiem"]}
