{"authors": ["George Hay"], "body": "A miner holds a lump of iron ore at a mine located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia December 2, 2013.\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Simon Thompson is in a tricky position. Rio Tinto\u2019s, chairman attempted last month to draw a line under the company\u2019s disastrous decision to blow up Aboriginal heritage sites to make way for iron ore mines. It didn\u2019t work. With shareholders pushing for something tougher than axing Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques\u2019 2020 bonus and a chunk of his long-term incentive plan, a bigger sacrifice is needed.\n\nViewed purely through the lens of shareholder value, Jacques\u2019 position should be secure. Rio\u2019s share price is up by over 40% over the last six months and near an all-time high; the FTSE 100 Index is flat over the same period. The Frenchman, in situ since 2016, has also avoided the industry pitfall of making a large, overpriced acquisition. His policy of sweating iron ore assets, which accounted for three-quarters of last year\u2019s group underlying EBITDA, makes sense considering the commodity fetches $127 a tonne, a six-year high.\n\nThe problem for Rio\u2019s board is that it is 2020, and many investors are paying closer attention to environmental, social and governance issues. Though the explosions at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia were legal, it\u2019s an ESG mess that also raises serious questions about the company\u2019s processes.\n\nAfter giving their initial consent to Rio\u2019s plans, the indigenous Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people concluded the sites were of exceptional archaeological significance long before they went up in smoke. Jacques\u2019 defence \u2013 that he wasn\u2019t told until it was too late \u2013 implies either poorly designed reporting lines or a reluctance among lower-ranking Rio executives to give the boss unwelcome news. Neither is a good look, or an easy cultural fix.\n\nThompson has three main options. He could dock more pay from Jacques. He could force out senior lieutenants such as iron ore boss Chris Salisbury, and maybe some directors. Or the chairman could conclude that Jacques has to go.\n\nThe first option looks inadequate and increases the risk that a substantial minority of Rio shareholders register their displeasure by voting against the board\u2019s remuneration report for the second year running. That would put the board in jeopardy. Too soft a response could also make it harder for Rio to secure mining licences elsewhere in the future. And there\u2019s a danger that the company becomes a pariah with ESG investors. With billions of dollars flowing into sustainable investing strategies, backing Jacques might prove costly.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:37.807166", "publish_date": "2020-09-10", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-10 09:10:52+00:00", "publish_time": "09:10:52", "source": "reuters", "title": "Breakingviews - Rio Tinto board can choose CEO \u2013 at expense of ESG", "topics": ["board", "shareholders", "ceo", "expense", "rio", "western", "ore", "tinto", "jacques", "iron", "secure", "esg", "rios", "position", "sites", "choose", "breakingviews"]}
