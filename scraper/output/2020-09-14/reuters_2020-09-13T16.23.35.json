{"authors": ["Rebecca Rubin"], "body": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - People who closely follow box office earnings have noticed a surprising lack of transparency surrounding ticket sales for \u201cTenet,\u201d the $200 million-budgeted sci-fi epic from director Christopher Nolan that released last weekend in U.S. theaters.\n\nThe Warner Bros logo is seen during the annual MIPCOM television programme market in Cannes, France, October 14, 2019. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nSince \u201cTenet\u201d premiered, Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, has parceled out carefully selected breadcrumbs of data to reporters and rival studios. Traditionally, studios share box office information on a daily basis. That\u2019s not the case with \u201cTenet.\u201d\n\nThough it started playing in theaters on Thursday, Sept. 3, Warner Bros. waited until Sunday, Sept. 6 to officially announce opening weekend grosses. \u201cTenet\u201d earned $20 million over the long weekend, a middling result for a film of its size.\n\nIndustry observers presumed that Warner Bros. wanted initial box office receipts for \u201cTenet\u201d to look as robust as possible -- and waiting until Sunday for the full weekend figure would make earnings sound stronger than they might if the studio had dribbled out daily numbers.\n\nThe studio, however, was concerned that reporters and rivals would misinterpret or unfairly analyze the results -- leading to headlines that may incorrectly label \u201cTenet\u2019s\u2019 debut as a flop. Warner Bros. urged journalists to provide context by noting that ticket sales would automatically be lower than normal given the fact that theaters in major markets like New York and Los Angeles aren\u2019t open and cinemas that have reopened have done so at reduced capacity. With those caveats in mind, Warner Bros. was never banking on a splashy opening weekend and instead hoped \u201cTenet\u201d would play in theaters for months without much in the way of competition.\n\nBox office reports are one of the most public-facing activities that studios undergo. A hit opening weekend allows them to trumpet the good news in advertisements and through internal communications. But there\u2019s a downside to those bragging rights. It also forces studios to own their mistakes -- a miss is a miss, after all. With streaming rivals such as Netflix and Amazon keeping a tight grip on the number of times films are watched and refusing to reveal box office data about their films, more traditional studios have grown frustrated. Some studio executives have even publicly carped about the need to report grosses, suggesting they\u2019d rather forgo the process all together.\n\nThough it is unusual for a major studio like Warner Bros. to shield grosses for perhaps the buzziest movie of the year, other Hollywood players had given the company a pass for opening weekend because \u201cTenet\u201d was the first significant movie to debut since coronavirus struck. Rival studios are closely watching the Nolan film as a test to see if people would go to the movies during the pandemic. The results, in effect, would help Hollywood decide whether or not to continue releasing big-budgeted tentpoles in the middle of a global health crisis.\n\nNumerous insiders at rival studios emphasized that they want Warner Bros. and \u201cTenet\u201d to succeed, citing the aphorism that rising tides lift all boats. But given the importance of the movie theater business, Hollywood executives at other studios have privately complained about the lack of transparency.\n\nIn normal times, executives that are involved in distributing films get access to grosses by the hour. Studios work with the research company Rentrak and its parent corporation Comscore to report daily numbers and publish box office charts each weekend that are widely distributed across the entertainment industry. Studios pay a lot of money to get down-to-the-minute updates, with the agreement that rivals have access to info from other distributors.\n\nAccording to individuals familiar with the situation, Rentrak had to get permission from major studio heads before concealing daily numbers for \u201cTenet.\u201d Though executives were initially reluctant, they ultimately agreed for the first weekend as a courtesy, believing that Warner Bros. was taking a bold bet in testing the waters and needed their support.\n\nBut as \u201cTenet\u201d continues into its second weekend in theaters, there has still been a dearth of information regarding box office data. The studio has yet to report daily figures, and is expected to wait until this Sunday to divulge ticket sales.\n\nWarner Bros. and Comscore declined to comment on this report. However, studio sources argue they aren\u2019t obligated to share numbers with anyone else and stress that there\u2019s no precedent for releasing a movie in a pandemic. Comparing \u201cTenet\u201d to any other movie, one source said, is \u201capples and kumquats.\u201d By distributing numbers in the traditional fashion, anyone on the outside could jump to conclusions and categorize \u201cTenet\u201d has a financial disaster. They argue that there\u2019s no difference between reporting numbers on Friday afternoon or Sunday morning.\n\nSources at other studios pointed out that some cinema owners, particularly those with drive-in locations, don\u2019t report weekend earnings to studios until Sunday. While normally that wouldn\u2019t make a notable dent in a final tally, drive-ins have become popular during the pandemic.\n\nAdding to anxieties for Hollywood is the concern that other studios might make similar agreements to conceal grosses for upcoming releases -- pushing box office revenues behind a curtain of inscrutability. Sony Pictures is already following suit, waiting until the end of this weekend to share sales for its romantic comedy \u201cThe Broken Hearts Gallery.\u201d\n\nThat could signal that Warner Bros. decision to withhold information and tightly control its box office reporting may no longer be the exception to the rule. It could signal a new precedent for media companies always eager to avoid scrutiny.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:37.116195", "publish_date": "2020-09-13", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-13 16:23:35+00:00", "publish_time": "16:23:35", "source": "reuters", "title": "Warner Bros.
