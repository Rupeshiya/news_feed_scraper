{"authors": ["Gabriel Crossley", "Sanjeev Miglani"], "body": "BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China and India said on Friday they had agreed to de-escalate renewed tensions on their contested Himalayan border and take steps to restore \u201cpeace and tranquillity\u201d following a high-level diplomatic meeting in Moscow.\n\nChinese State Councillor Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar met in Moscow on Thursday and reached a five-point consensus, including agreements that troops from both sides should quickly disengage and ease tensions, the two countries said in a joint statement.\n\nThe consensus, struck on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, came after a confrontation in the border area in the western Himalayas earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThe two Foreign Ministers agreed that the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions,\u201d they said in the statement.\n\nJaishankar told Wang that the immediate task would be for troops to step back from the \u201careas of friction\u201d so that things do not get worse, an Indian source said. Troops are barely a few hundred metres apart at some points.\n\nChina and India accused each other of firing into the air during the confrontation, a violation of long-held protocol not to use firearms on the sensitive frontier.\n\nWang told Jaishankar the \u201cimperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions that violate the commitments made by the two sides,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.\n\nWang also told Jaishankar all personnel and equipment that have trespassed at the border must be moved to de-escalate the situation.\n\nIn June, tensions erupted into a frontier clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties.\n\nShares of defence-related firms fell in China on Friday after the news of progress in the talks, with the CSI National Defense Industry Index down 1.2% and on track for its steepest weekly decline since Oct. 12, 2018. Tongyu Heavy Industry shares tumbled as much as 16.4% at one point.\n\nCHINESE BUILDUP\n\nThe ministers\u2019 meeting lasted for two hours and was the latest diplomatic effort to head off a broader conflict between the world\u2019s two most populous countries, which went to war in 1962.\n\nJaishankar told Wang that India was deeply concerned about the buildup of Chinese forces on the Line of Actual Control on the poorly defined border.\n\nChinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Moscow, Russia September 10, 2020.
