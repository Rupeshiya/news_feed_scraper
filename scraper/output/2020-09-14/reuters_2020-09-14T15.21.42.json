(Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has added top lawyers to his staff and launched a \u201cspecial litigation\u201d team as his campaign braces for potential legal fights over the outcome of the Nov. 3 U.S. election against President Donald Trump.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic U.S. presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign stop in Warren, Michigan, U.S., September 9, 2020. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign for months has been ramping up what it calls the largest voter protection program in presidential election history, after Trump repeatedly has suggested without evidence that the election could be \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said on Monday that Bob Bauer, a New York University law school professor and former Obama administration counsel, had joined as a full-time senior campaign adviser working on voter protection efforts with campaign General Counsel Dana Remus.\n\nMarc Elias, a top elections lawyer at the firm Perkins Coie, was running a team focused on \u201cprotecting voter access to the polls and a fair and accurate vote count\u201d state by state, the campaign said.\n\nFormer Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger have been brought on to run a national special litigation unit, and former Attorney General Eric Holder will play a leading role in communicating with \u201call stakeholders in voting rights,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nReuters reported in July that the Biden campaign was preparing for a contested election outcome, and that Bauer and Elias were involved in the contingency planning.\n\nTogether, the teams are providing legal, communications and political strategies for administering the vote at a time when the coronavirus pandemic and an expected surge in voting by mail have raised concerns that the outcome could be delayed well beyond the Nov. 3 election.\n\nThe campaign said the teams would respond aggressively to voter suppression activities, as well as identify and counter \u201cforeign interference and misinformation from foreign or domestic sources.\u201d\n\nBiden on Monday told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, that the American people would insist that all votes be counted come November.\n\n\u201cI have confidence that Trump will try to not have that happen, but I\u2019m confident the American public is going to insist on it,\u201d Biden said after casting an early vote ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary election in his home state.\n\nTrump has cast doubt on the legitimacy of mail-in ballots, which have been used in far greater numbers in primary elections amid the pandemic.\n\nHe has refused to say he would accept official election results if he lost and has suggested at times that the election be postponed, something he does not have the power to do.\n\nThe Republican Party also has a substantial legal effort underway focused on blocking some states from mailing absentee ballots to all registered voters. It argues the U.S. election system is not ready for the vote-by-mail changes hastened in many places by the coronavirus and could be overwhelmed.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:19.334480", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 15:21:42+00:00", "publish_time": "15:21:42", "source": "reuters", "title": "Biden adds top lawyers to teams preparing for election legal battles", "topics": ["wilmington", "lawyers", "adds", "general", "battles", "teams", "campaign", "preparing", "voter", "outcome", "vote", "election", "presidential", "legal", "biden"]}
