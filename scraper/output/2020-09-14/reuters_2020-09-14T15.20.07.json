{"authors": ["Ahmed Eljechtimi"], "body": "RABAT (Reuters) - Working conditions are so bad for some medics in Morocco handling a surging coronavirus outbreak that they have staged protests against inadequate staffing and poorly equipped facilities.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Medical staff protest for higher pay and better working conditions in Rabat, Morocco September 10, 2020. REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal\n\nThe kingdom recorded a record 2,430 cases on Friday and has confirmed more than 1,000 new cases every day since July - the steepest increase among its North African peers.\n\nSome intensive care units in hospitals are overrun while other wards are full, according to unions representing health workers, and the national nurses\u2019 movement said at least 526 of their members had been infected, aggravating staff shortages.\n\nAnas Qarim, a nurse working at a hospital designated to treat COVID-19 in the central city of Meknes, said there were just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients.\n\n\u201cImagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,\u201d he said, speaking at a protest last week by dozens of medics in Rabat demanding better pay and conditions, at least the third such demonstration in two weeks.\n\nA Health Ministry spokesman did not respond to requests for comment about working conditions and inadequate staffing.\n\nKing Mohammed VI said last month that the health situation \u201cdoes not leave much room for optimism\u201d.\n\nDespite an intense three-month lockdown, the virus spread in Morocco and surged after restrictions were lifted, reaching more than 86,000 cases in total.\n\nFor patients, problems have mounted. Queues for testing start forming at 5 a.m. at the Sheikh Khalifa hospital in Casablanca, three hours before opening time, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nThose who are seriously sick struggle to get into hospital. Fatima Zahra Ait Lmahjoub already had three other members of her family in hospital with COVID-19 when her 71-year-old mother fell ill.\n\nShe said it took her 12 hours to find a bed, and she had to ask at four different hospitals.\n\n\u201cMy mother was unable to walk or breathe normally. Public hospitals didn\u2019t even offer an ambulance and asked me to take her by taxi,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nLACK OF TRUST\n\nIn Marrakech, rights activist Brahim Himmi said he had to wait nine hours to see a doctor at the Ibn Zorh hospital, where he said conditions were \u201cfilthy and crowded\u201d.Last month, pictures shared on social media showed patients lying on the floor there, causing an outcry from rights groups in the country.\n\n\u201cMany people go to hospital only when their symptoms are aggravated, because they don\u2019t trust the already frail health system,\u201d said Himmi, who recovered from COVID-19 in August.\n\nThe hospital did not respond when called for comment.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed poor conditions at the Ibn Baja hospital in the northern city of Taza. In one, patients complained of not seeing a doctor for over a week.\n\nThey said they were given medication including hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug which several placebo-controlled studies suggest is ineffective to either treat or prevent the disease.\n\nIn one video, a patient at the same hospital could be seen helping to install an oxygen cylinder for a young woman who was struggling to breathe, because no staff were available.\n\nThe hospital did not respond when called for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.\n\nThe Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents equipped with beds and oxygen. The government has also spurred industry to manufacture equipment.\n\nBut some medics say that staff shortages are the main problem, especially in poorer, less-developed rural areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) said there was only one doctor per 4,150 people in the southeastern Daraa Tafilalet region.\n\nIt recommends a minimum of 2.4 medics per 1,000 people. Nationally, Morocco has 0.7 doctors and 1.3 nurses per thousand, it said. Last year, the health ministry said there was a shortage of 32,000 doctors and 64,000 nurses.\n\n\u201cMorocco needs more medical staff,\u201d said Jamal Eddine Kohen, head of the federation of intensive care doctors.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:29.076399", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 15:20:07+00:00", "publish_time": "15:20:07", "source": "reuters", "title": "Moroccan medics protest over conditions, staff shortages as pandemic surges", "topics": ["hours", "conditions", "treat", "medics", "working", "health", "pandemic", "surges", "hospital", "morocco", "moroccan", "staff", "doctors", "protest", "shortages"]}
