REUTERS/Christinne Muschi\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault on Thursday announced fines for people who fail to wear a mask in indoor public spaces as more Canadian provinces step up efforts to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe fines are set to kick in on Saturday, though the details of the amount have not yet announced. Legault said fines would be more than C$50 (29.53 pounds). Quebec, the country\u2019s second most populous province, has been hard hit by the epidemic and accounts for just under half of Canada\u2019s 134,294 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the latest government data showed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a minority of irresponsible people, those people are putting our health at risk especially that of the elderly ... it is time to penalize them,\u201d Legault told reporters in Quebec City.\n\nEarlier this week, British Columbia ordered the closure of all nightclubs and Ontario delayed an easing of remaining restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus epidemic, as Canada reported a spike in new COVID-19 cases.\n\nA total of 9,155 people have died from COVID-19 in Canada.\n\nAuthorities are on high alert for any fresh outbreaks, as most schools across Canada resume classes after being shut for more then six months. Alberta on Wednesday reported 16 coronavirus cases across as many schools, though most of the infections were acquired elsewhere.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:36.457341", "publish_date": "2020-09-10", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-10 16:40:00+00:00", "publish_time": "16:40:00", "source": "reuters", "title": "Quebec to fine people for not wearing face masks in indoor public areas", "topics": ["wearing", "fines", "schools", "fine", "areas", "restrictions", "reported", "coronavirus", "masks", "legault", "covid19", "indoor", "epidemic", "canada", "face", "public", "quebec"]}
