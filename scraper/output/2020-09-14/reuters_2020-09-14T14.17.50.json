I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t know what is going on behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he has spoken to (ECB chief executive) Tom Harrison. I have spoken to Tom and we have stuff running in the background.\u201d\n\nEngland also wore \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d logos on their shirts during their test series against West Indies, but opted not to continue the practice against Pakistan and Australia.\n\nAlthough England\u2019s cricket team stopped taking a knee, the country\u2019s soccer team took a knee before their UEFA Nations League matches while Premier League clubs have also continued to do the same after the new season kicked off over the weekend.\n\nEngland and Australia are level at 1-1 in the one-day international series with the decider to be played on Wednesday in Manchester. The hosts won the three-match Twenty20 series 2-1 in Southampton last week.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:46.102159", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 14:17:50+00:00", "publish_time": "14:17:50", "source": "reuters", "title": "'No one has forgotten about Black Lives Matter', Archer tells Holding", "topics": ["holding", "lives", "took", "forgotten", "west", "series", "archer", "matter", "taking", "knee", "tells", "black", "indies"]}
