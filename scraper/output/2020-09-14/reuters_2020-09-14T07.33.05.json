REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/Files\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings said on Monday that it was expecting India\u2019s economy to shrink by 9% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, larger than its previous estimate of a 5% contraction, as the country reels under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ratings firm joins a host of major banks and ratings agencies, which have made deep cuts to their forecasts on India\u2019s economy following a 23.9% contraction in April-June, as consumer spending, private investments and exports collapsed during one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns.\n\nS&P\u2019s latest revision comes three months after it made its projection on India\u2019s real GDP for fiscal 2021.\n\n\u201cWhile India eased lockdowns in June, we believe the pandemic will continue to restrain economic activity ... As long as the virus spread remains uncontained, consumers will be cautious in going out and spending and firms will be under strain,\u201d S&P said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe potential for further support monetary support is curbed by India\u2019s inflation worries,\u201d said Vishrut Rana, Asia-Pacific economist for S&P Global Ratings. The Reserve Bank of India has cut policy rates by 115 basis points so far this year.\n\nRetail inflation data, due later in the day, is likely to have stayed above the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s medium-term target range in August for the fifth straight month, according to a Reuters poll.\n\nIndia\u2019s high deficit also limits the scope for further fiscal stimulus, S&P added. It expects GDP growth of 6% in fiscal 2022 and 6.2% in fiscal 2023.\n\nMoody\u2019s on Friday said it was expecting India\u2019s real GDP to contract by 11.5% in fiscal 2020.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:07.340347", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 07:33:05+00:00", "publish_time": "07:33:05", "source": "reuters", "title": "S&P expects India's economy to contract 9% in fiscal 2021", "topics": ["economy", "reserve", "indias", "expects", "fiscal", "2021", "spread", "sp", "spending", "india", "support", "gdp", "ratings", "contract"]}
