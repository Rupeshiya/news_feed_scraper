REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov\n\nThe apparent assassination attempt has brought tensions between Russia and Europe to new heights and fuelled calls for sanctions against Moscow - including scrapping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Kremlin flagship project to bring more Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of using the incident as a pretext to impose additional sanctions on Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nGerman army doctors at Berlin\u2019s Charite hospital, to which Navalny was evacuated after falling unconscious during a flight over Siberia last month, were the first to say he had been poisoned with Novichok. Navalny awoke from a coma last week.\n\nGerman government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the initial findings had now been independently corroborated by laboratories in France and Sweden.\n\nSamples taken from the Russian opposition politician had also been sent to the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague for additional tests in their labs, Seibert added.\n\n\u201cWe renew our call for Russia to explain these events,\u201d Seibert said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said in a statement after holding a telephone call with President Vladimir Putin that Moscow had to explain itself now.\n\n\u201cThe president expressed his deep concern over the criminal act perpetrated against Alexei Navalany and the imperative that all light be shed, without delay, on the circumstances and responsibilities of this attempted assassination,\u201d Macron\u2019s office said.\n\nMacron expressed his full solidarity with Germany on the steps to be taken and the consequences to be drawn from the situation, it added.\n\n\u201cClarification is needed from Russia in the context of a credible and transparent investigation,\u201d the Elysee said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin told Macron that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to make groundless accusations against Russia over the Navalny case.\n\nPutin said that Russia wanted Germany to hand over medical test results taken from Navalny, the Kremlin added.\n\nIn an update on Navalny\u2019s health status, the Charite hospital said his condition continued to improve.\n\n\u201cThe patient has been successfully removed from mechanical ventilation. He is currently undergoing mobilization and is able to leave his bed for short periods of time,\u201d it said.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:35.520117", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 08:24:37+00:00", "publish_time": "08:24:37", "source": "reuters", "title": "Germany, France call on Russia to investigate Navalny's Novichok poisoning", "topics": ["investigate", "navalny", "seibert", "germany", "russian", "politician", "opposition", "taken", "france", "president", "novichok", "russia", "navalnys", "kremlin", "poisoning"]}
