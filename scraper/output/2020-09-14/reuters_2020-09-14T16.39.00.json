Avshalom Sassoni/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nThe deaths of 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh and his parents Saad and Riham in the village of Duma contributed to a surge of Israeli-Palestinian violence after peace talks stalled in 2014.\n\nAmiram Ben-Uliel, 21 at the time of the killings, was convicted in May of three counts of murder and two charges of attempted murder in what a court determined were racially-motivated crimes.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Shin Bet internal security service, which had interrogated Ben-Uliel, hailed that verdict as \u201can important milestone in the struggle against Jewish terrorism\u201d.\n\nBut Palestinians see Israel as sluggish in cracking down on Jewish militants, compared with the speedy and sometimes lethal response by security forces to violence by Arabs.\n\nOn Monday, a district court in Lod in central Israel sentenced Ben-Uliel to three consecutive life terms for the murders and another 20 years for the attempted murders.\n\nBen-Uliel firebombed the Dawabsheh family home and another dwelling in Duma after spray-painting \u201cRevenge\u201d and \u201cLong Live King Messiah\u201d on their walls, the Lod court found.\n\nAnother Dawabsheh son, Ahmed, survived with severe burns.\n\nBen-Uliel has said he intends to appeal the conviction.\n\n\u201cHe asserts his innocence and contends the confession was extracted through torture,\u201d Ben-Uliel\u2019s attorney, Itzak Bam, told Reuters.\n\nBut the court\u2019s ruling said his confession included details from the arson scene that only a perpetrator could know. He was acquitted of a charge of belonging to a terrorist organisation.\n\nA second, underage defendant in the case was convicted as an accessory as part of a plea bargain. His sentence is pending.\n\nIsraeli officials say investigations into Duma and other attacks by Jewish militants against Palestinians have been hampered by the suspects\u2019 operating in tight-knit cells and eluding electronic surveillance.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:08.129195", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 16:39:00+00:00", "publish_time": "16:39:00", "source": "reuters", "title": "Israeli who killed Palestinian baby, parents gets life imprisonment", "topics": ["imprisonment", "killed", "palestinian", "violence", "lod", "gets", "court", "israel", "arson", "west", "baby", "dawabsheh", "jewish", "life", "duma", "parents", "benuliel", "israeli"]}
