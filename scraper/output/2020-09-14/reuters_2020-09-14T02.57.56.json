{"authors": ["Jeff Mason"], "body": "HENDERSON, Nev. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump held a Nevada campaign rally at an indoor venue on Sunday despite public health professionals\u2019 warnings against large indoor gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA Republican, Trump railed against his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, suggesting that he was somehow soft on crime and, without evidence, that he was taking drugs.\n\n\u201cBiden wants to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists,\u201d Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd. \u201cIf Biden wins, the mob wins.\u201d\n\nThe president sought to back up his drug accusation by citing what he considered Biden\u2019s poor performance in debates with rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cI called for a drug test because, you know what? I want a drug test, because we don\u2019t want to have a situation like we could have with this guy,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAsked to respond to Trump\u2019s drug remarks, the Biden campaign had no comment and instead criticized the president\u2019s leadership amid the unrest in cities over racial injustice.\n\nPeople in the Nevada crowd were seated close together and many did not wear masks.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nNevada\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, fired off a series of tweets describing the large, indoor gathering as high risk and calling Trump\u2019s decision to hold it \u201creckless and selfish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President appears to have forgotten that this country is still in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d Sisolak tweeted.\n\nBiden as criticized Trump for holding campaign events that put people at risk of contracting the coronavirus, which has killed more than 194,000 people in the United States.\n\nTrump played down the virus in its early stages and has alternately embraced and disregarded advice from public health experts, who encourage mask-wearing and maintaining social distance to prevent its spread.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign portrayed the rally at a large warehouse in Henderson as an opportunity for supporters to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.\n\n\u201cIf you can join tens of thousands of people protesting in the streets, gamble in a casino, or burn down small businesses in riots, you can gather peacefully under the First Amendment to hear from the president of the United States,\u201d spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nHealthcare experts say chances of infection are greater at indoor events than at outdoor ones.\n\nParticipants at the rally were to have temperatures taken before entry and be given a mask they would be encouraged to wear, the campaign said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re relatively safe here. I brought a mask but I haven\u2019t felt the need to wear it,\u201d said Ronda Livingston, 64. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is trailing Biden in national opinion polls and in Nevada, has stepped up the frequency of his rallies in recent weeks, but has held most of them at outdoor venues or in large open airplane hangars to help minimize risk.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:45:09.743589", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 02:57:56+00:00", "publish_time": "02:57:56", "source": "reuters", "title": "Trump holds campaign rally indoors despite coronavirus concerns", "topics": ["risk", "holds", "trump", "rally", "coronavirus", "campaign", "drug", "concerns", "president", "wear", "indoors", "indoor", "large", "biden", "despite"]}
