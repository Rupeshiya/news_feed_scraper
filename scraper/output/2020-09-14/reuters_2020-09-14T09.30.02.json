{"authors": ["Vladimir Soldatkin"], "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowed a $1.5 billion (1.16 billion pounds) loan on Belarus on Monday in a gesture of support for its leader Alexander Lukashenko, who flew to entreat his patron for help as demonstrations showed no sign of abating.\n\nA day after more than 100,000 protesters demonstrated in Minsk for the fifth straight weekend to demand his resignation following an election they say was rigged, Lukashenko, who has led Russia\u2019s closest ally for 26 years, met Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to thank you...personally thank you and all Russians, all those, and I will not list them, who were involved in supporting us during this post-election time,\u201d Lukashenko said after the talks.\n\nPutin gave few details about the new loan, which he said Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin had agreed during a recent visit to the Belarusian capital.\n\nThe Russian leader also signalled support for Lukashenko in other ways and said defence cooperation would continue. Hours earlier, Russian news agencies reported Moscow was sending paratroopers for joint exercises.\n\nPutin also backed plans Lukashenko has previously announced for constitutional reform, which the opposition has dismissed as a stunt to keep power after the Aug. 9 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe want Belarusians themselves, without prompting and pressure from outside, to sort out this situation in a calm manner and through dialogue and to find a common solution,\u201d Putin said.\n\nDespite aggressive action from his security forces, Lukashenko has failed to reclaim the streets from demonstrators, who taunted him on Sunday with chants of \u201cYou\u2019re a rat!\u201d\n\nLukashenko calls the demonstrations a Western plot and has placed his fate in Moscow\u2019s hands, requesting economic support and military aid.\n\nSince the election, which Lukashenko denies rigging, thousands of people have been arrested and nearly all opposition leaders jailed, deported or forced into exile. Police said they detained 774 people on Sunday.\n\nThe opposition says it fears Lukashenko could try to sell out Belarusian independence for Putin\u2019s support. Opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said no agreement reached by Lukashenko with Putin would be valid.\n\n\u201cI want to remind Vladimir Putin: whatever you accept and whatever you agree upon during the meeting in Sochi will have no legal weight,\u201d she wrote on social media site Telegram.\n\n\u201cAll the agreements signed with an illegitimate Lukashenko will be revised by the new leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very sorry that you have decided to engage in dialogue with a dictator and not the Belarusian people.\u201d\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nWEST TREADS CAREFULLY\n\nThe West has acted carefully, balancing sympathy with the pro-democracy movement against fear of provoking Russian intervention.\n\nEuropean leaders have repeatedly phoned Putin to express concern. French President Emmanuel Macron was the latest, with Paris saying he repeated calls for a peaceful solution respecting the will of the Belarusian people.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nLukashenko, 66, has been a prickly ally of Russia in the past, and has had an awkward personal relationship with Putin. But the Kremlin has made clear it does not want to see an ally toppled by street protests.\n\nPutin said last month he had set up a \u201creserve police force\u201d at Lukashenko\u2019s request, to be deployed if needed. Russia has offered to restructure Belarusian debt and support its banks, and sent journalists to operate Belarusian state TV after staff quit in protest against what they called propaganda.\n\nBelarus has the closest political, social, economic and defence relationships with Russia of any former Soviet republic. The two countries proclaimed a \u201cunion state\u201d in the 1990s, complete with a Soviet-style red flag.\n\nThe Kremlin has long sought closer integration. Lukashenko has resisted some of those measures.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:30.238167", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 09:30:02+00:00", "publish_time": "09:30:02", "source": "reuters", "title": "Putin bestows $1.5 billion loan in gesture of support for Belarus leader", "topics": ["billion", "15", "russian", "loan", "lukashenko", "opposition", "gesture", "west", "vladimir", "belarus", "russia", "belarusian", "bestows", "support", "leader", "putin", "ally"]}
