{"authors": ["Crispin Kyala"], "body": "KAMITUGA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Kinyenye Furaha passed out from shock when he realised a mine collapse in eastern Congo had buried more than 50 fellow miners including his brother, he said on Sunday, as the hunt continued for bodies two days after the disaster.\n\nMiners searching the site near the town of Kamituga in Democratic Republic of Congo have so far recovered 18 bodies, after heavy rains on Friday caused the artisanal gold mine to cave in, burying those working below ground.\n\nBefore the rain started, Furaha had left the site to remove some large rocks. Soon after, a child ran up to say water was rising in the mine, Furaha told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe went back there and found only the pit filled with water. And that\u2019s when I lost consciousness,\u201d he said.\n\nDozens of people die each year in accidents in largely unregulated artisanal mines in Congo, where often ill-equipped diggers borrow deep underground in search of ore.\n\nThis time, miners were caught out because the wet season is yet to get fully underway, said Kamituga Mayor Alexandre Bundia.\n\n\u201cThe main problem is that people did not heed the rain,\u201d he said outside his office in the mining town in Congo\u2019s mountainous and mineral-rich South Kivu province.\n\nScores of men in rubber boots gathered again on Sunday at the mine site on a muddy hillside. A rescue team passed sacks of earth out of the pit in the search for the buried miners, who are all presumed dead.\n\nRecovery efforts will continue on Monday morning, local official Kimbulungu Kyalondawa said.\n\nBack in Kamituga, women gathered to mourn their lost relatives. Sitting close together on the floor, they stared into the distance without speaking, while one held a sleeping baby to her chest.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:29.134030", "publish_date": "2020-09-13", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-13 18:48:39+00:00", "publish_time": "18:48:39", "source": "reuters", "title": "Survivor recalls horror after Congo mine collapse", "topics": ["water", "survivor", "kamituga", "recalls", "rain", "site", "search", "republic", "miners", "furaha", "horror", "congo", "town", "collapse"]}
