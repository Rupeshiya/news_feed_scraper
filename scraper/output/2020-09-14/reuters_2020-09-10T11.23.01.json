REUTERS/Jayanta Dey/Files\n\nOfficials in New Delhi are expected to soon ask importers to register with authorities as a first step towards tighter controls that would require permits for individual shipments of the two metals, government sources said. The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the discussions.\n\nThe move for greater screening is aimed at pushing economic self-reliance, the federal mines ministry said in a letter to the commerce ministry late last month. The letter reviewed by Reuters refers to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s push to reduce imports and increase exports of value-added products.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of (the) system is to have adequate information ... so that an appropriate policy intervention could be devised,\u201d the mines ministry said in the letter.\n\nGovernment sources said the aim of the tighter surveillance would be to move copper and aluminium imports onto a restricted items list, which would require importers to get a government-issued license for every shipment.\n\nIndia\u2019s federal mines and commerce ministries did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThe screening will help us devise policies like adding one or both the metals to the restricted list of goods as we will have enough data to see what is being dumped into the country,\u201d one government official said.\n\nChina, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand are among the major exporters of copper, accounting for 45% of India\u2019s $5 billion in copper imports for 2019/20, government data showed.\n\nIndia plans a similar mechanism for aluminium imports, which mainly come from China, the sources said.\n\n\u201cChina is a huge threat for India\u2019s aluminium industry,\u201d B.K. Bhatia, joint secretary general at Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI), the country\u2019s biggest mining lobby, told Reuters.\n\nSince April, about 58% of India\u2019s aluminium demand has been met by scrap imports, at prices 22% cheaper than domestic primary aluminium, according to industry data.\n\nIndia imported around $4.4 billion worth of aluminium in 2019/20, government data showed. China was the biggest supplier, shipping aluminium worth just over $1 billion.\n\nIndia has increased its trade and investment barriers against Chinese firms after a deadly clash in June along the disputed Himalayan border.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:21.637604", "publish_date": "2020-09-10", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-10 11:23:01+00:00", "publish_time": "11:23:01", "source": "reuters", "title": "India plans to restrict copper, aluminium imports with an eye on China: sources", "topics": ["mines", "china", "aluminium", "indias", "data", "sources", "restrict", "ministry", "plans", "imports", "india", "eye", "industry", "copper"]}
