REUTERS/Chris Keane\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Another report on the risks of climate change ought to be unnecessary as wildfires rage across America\u2019s Pacific states. But that\u2019s what appeared on Wednesday at the behest of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The document\u2019s main strength is its obviousness.\n\nWhat makes the report, entitled \u201cManaging climate risk in the U.S. financial system,\u201d stand out is that it is not trying to make scientific revelations or present more big, scary numbers. Instead, it rehearses the dangers that financial markets and participants face, putting them in language that Wall Street understands. That\u2019s no surprise: The chairman of the CFTC subcommittee behind the paper is Bob Litterman, a former partner and risk manager at Goldman Sachs who is now chairman of the risk committee at Kepos Capital.\n\nA good number of the report\u2019s 53 recommendations also look familiar. They have been suggested or adopted in Europe and elsewhere. They include setting a carbon price and joining various cross-border groups like the Network for Greening the Financial System, which includes virtually all the world\u2019s major central banks except the Federal Reserve. Also on the list is a call for mandatory climate-risk disclosures by companies, as well as integrating relevant analysis into regulatory work and even U.S. fiscal policy.\n\nThe CFTC report received unanimous approval from its 34-member subcommittee, including agriculture giants Cargill and Bunge, BP and ConocoPhillips representing Big Oil, as well as Wall Street giants Citigroup and JPMorgan. That\u2019s starting to get significant players on the same page.\n\nInitiatives of the kind proposed can, however, only be really useful if the underlying data points are robust and standardized. That\u2019s an issue the report addresses at length, and one that has yet to be solved anywhere.\n\nLitterman and some of his subcommittee colleagues are already working on it. Last week they unveiled an open-source climate data and analytics repository. It\u2019s administered by nonprofit OS-Climate \u2013 whose boss Truman Semans also served on the CFTC group \u2013 under the newly formed LF Climate Finance Foundation.\n\nThere are some powerful backers, too: Allianz, Amazon.com, Microsoft, S&P Global and the Linux Foundation are behind the project. Soon virtually everyone but the U.S. federal government will be pulling in the same direction.", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:37.852859", "publish_date": "2020-09-09", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-09 21:10:12+00:00", "publish_time": "21:10:12", "source": "reuters", "title": "Breakingviews - U.S. climate report\u2019s obviousness is its strength", "topics": ["risk", "system", "subcommittee", "report", "strength", "wall", "obviousness", "virtually", "reports", "thats", "financial", "climate", "cftc", "breakingviews"]}
