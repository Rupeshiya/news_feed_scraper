REUTERS/Stringer\n\n\u201cIndividuals will now be quarantined for 14 days as per COVID-19 protocol and will thereafter be handed over to their family members,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Harsh Wardhan Pande, a spokesman for the Indian army, said in a statement.\n\nPande said the five youths had \u201cinadvertently strayed\u201d across the de-facto border while foraging and hunting, adding that two other such incidents had taken place this year in India\u2019s Arunachal Pradesh state, which borders China.\n\nHowever, a Chinese state-backed tabloid said the five were Indian intelligence agents dressed as hunters, disputing claims that they had been kidnapped.\n\nBilateral relations have been unusually tense since a clash at a disputed border area in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers, with an unknown number of Chinese casualties.\n\nOn Tuesday, following reports that five Indians from the state of Arunachal Pradesh had gone missing, an Indian minister said that the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army confirmed they had been found in China.\n\nTheir disappearance coincided with a border confrontation that week in the western Himalayas, during which both accused the other of firing in the air.\n\nThe two sides have long observed a protocol avoiding the use of firearms in the undemarcated frontier, though violence has erupted in the past.\n\nOn Thursday, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar met in Moscow and agreed to de-escalate the border tensions.\n\nGlobal Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on the Chinese Twitter-like app Weibo that China-India relations were stabilising. Observers of China\u2019s foreign relations often watch Hu\u2019s messages on social media to gauge sentiment from Beijing policymakers.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the successive meetings between the Chinese and Indian defence ministers and foreign ministers have played a positive role in cooling the situation,\u201d Hu wrote.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the People\u2019s Liberation Army defended every inch of the country\u2019s land, and the Indian Army ultimately failed to take advantage of it.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-14 22:44:21.190397", "publish_date": "2020-09-12", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-12 08:55:06+00:00", "publish_time": "08:55:06", "source": "reuters", "title": "Five Indian nationals detained in China handed over: Indian army", "topics": ["china", "state", "region", "relations", "indian", "foreign", "army", "handed", "border", "protocol", "pradesh", "detained", "chinese", "nationals"]}
