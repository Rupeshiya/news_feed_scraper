{"authors": ["Ben Mathis-Lilley"], "body": "The first 10 minutes of the Tuesday night presidential debate were, frankly, some of the worst stuff anyone has ever seen. Donald Trump kept interrupting Joe Biden and moderator Chris Wallace. Biden looked stunned and was mostly unable to finish a sentence. The silence of the small, COVID-era audience made everything weird. Trump just kept interrupting\u2014taunting, really\u2014and it was horrible!\n\nAfter that, well, it didn\u2019t get that much better. It wasn\u2019t a civil, detailed exchange about plans and values. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, in her post-debate summing-up, called the whole thing a \u201cshitshow.\u201d But there were at moments when Biden got to speak for more than a minute without being jabbered over and through, and moments when Wallace got Trump to answer a direct question. Here, based on these intelligible sections of the broadcast, is one unfailingly accurate pundit\u2019s assessment of which candidates helped reach the voters they needed to reach and which did not.\n\nCandidates who, at the very least, tried to reach undecided and otherwise wavering voters: Joe Biden.\n\nBiden, as he did during the primary debates, occasionally fumbled over his answers and tossed in half-phrased allusions that probably didn\u2019t land with people who didn\u2019t already know what, for example, methane regulations are all about. As mentioned, he initially looked taken aback and unable to concentrate because of the frequency with which Trump was interrupting him.\n\nBut Biden had one trick up his sleeve, and it was a good one: turning to face the stage-right camera (rather than looking toward Wallace or at Trump) and making a show of ignoring whatever Trump was saying in order to give an assessment, straight onto America\u2019s TV screens, of the big-picture condition of the country, often one that incorporated second-person \u201cyour family\u201d or \u201cpeople at home\u201d language. It was the classic posture of a politician addressing a message to the entire public\u2014supporters, undecided voters, and even the opposing side, if they care to listen.\n\nBiden repeatedly, for example, turned to the viewers at home as he steered the discussion back to Trump\u2019s culpability for the COVID-19 pandemic, which polls consistently say is the No. 1 issue in the election. \u201cHow many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow many were in a situation where you lost your mom or dad or couldn\u2019t even speak to them and had a nurse holding the phone so you could, in fact, say goodbye?\u201d He tied the pandemic to the economy\u2014obvious, but fair\u2014and observed that \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d like Trump are still doing fine while \u201cyou folks at home living in Scranton and all these small and working-class towns\u201d are generally not. Later, he conveyed the scope of the crisis in stark terms, noting that Trump \u201cwill be the first president of the United States to leave office having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president.\u201d He talked about the paradox of \u201creopening\u201d the economy before COVID is contained: \u201cThe idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and cases, in the United States of America, and he wants to open it more?\u201d Again: obvious stuff. But reflective of the views of the majority of people who are going to vote in the election!\n\nWhen the subject turned to race relations and civil rights, Biden had a more strategically narrow line to walk: A significant chunk of the people in his party, particularly younger ones, believe that radical change is necessary to address racial oppression. But a perhaps equally significant chunk of older, white Democrats and independents say they place a greater value on concepts like \u201cstability.\u201d Biden had to talk to both groups.\n\nHe did so by emphasizing that he recognizes that the current situation is not tenable\u2014but doing it in terms of values rather than specifics. A majority of potential voters may not agree on whether the police should be abolished, but they agree that Joe Biden\u2019s beliefs about racial progress are more in line with theirs than Donald Trump\u2019s are. Said Biden about the summer\u2019s protests and Trump\u2019s response to them: \u201cIt\u2019s about equity and equality. It\u2019s about decency. It\u2019s about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But\u2014we\u2019ve never accomplished it, but we\u2019ve never walked away from it like he has done.\u201d He defended the \u201cracial sensitivity\u201d office trainings that Trump has forbidden the federal government from conducting: \u201cThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity, and people have to be made aware of what other people feel like, and what insults them and what is demeaning to them. It is important that people know.\u201d At one point, he mocked Trump for living in \u201c1950\u201d and not realizing that Black and Hispanic people have moved to \u201cthe suburbs\u201d too.\n\nBiden concluded, in discussing Wallace\u2019s loaded closing topic of \u201celection integrity,\u201d with a reassuring note about the stable transition of the presidency. \u201cIf we get the votes, it is all over. He will go. He cannot stay in power. It won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen. Vote. Make sure you understand you have in your control for the country will look like the next four years. Will it be a change, or four more years of these lies?\u201d\n\nBiden was exasperated and exhausted, and that came through. But he was also compassionate and level-headed.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nCandidates who seemingly had no strategy except ignoring the debate format to make constant condescending, belittling remarks about Biden that were essentially incomprehensible to anyone who is not already heavily invested in the sealed-off semantics and mythology of Fox News prime-time shows and MAGA Facebook memes: Donald Trump.\n\nYou can read here about the moment that Trump told a white nationalist street gang, the Proud Boys, to \u201cstand by.\u201d But there was so much more! Picture yourself as a suburban Arizona voter concerned about the country\u2019s future, listening to the president of the U.S. make the following choices about what subjects to bring up to a bipartisan national TV audience with an election a month away:\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college.\u201d This is a reference to a debunked claim that has bounced around right-wing sites such as the Murdoch-owned New York Post and the Washington Times about Biden not knowing where he went to school.\n\n\u2022 About Biden and masks: \u201cEvery time you see him, he is wearing one. He could be speaking 200 feet away and he shows up with the biggest mask I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Most of the public favors mask-wearing; the idea that someone would be wearing a mask too much is alien outside the section of the Venn diagram where anti-vaccine conspiracists meet the president\u2019s most fervent loyalists.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife gave your son $3.5 million. What did he do to deserve that?\u201d Trump\u2019s ultimate source here appears to be a \u201cconfidential document\u201d cited in a Republican Senate report, also recently written up in the New York Post, that is said to show a payment to a company Biden\u2019s son Hunter co-founded. Trump brought up the $3.5 million twice more.\n\n\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s all on tape, by the way\u2014you gave the idea for the Logan Act against Gen. Flynn.\u201d This is a \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracy theory outlined on the notoriously unreliable website of the Hill. You can read about in the Washington Post here; it\u2019s based on some ambiguously worded notes involving the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton where it was a whole big con job.\u201d A reference to Tuesday\u2019s decision by John Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, to release an anti-Clinton Russian intelligence assessment that was widely understood to be bogus and created as disinformation.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThey are sending millions of ballots all over the country. They have found them in creeks.\u201d The Washington Post notes tastefully that it is \u201cunclear what the creek reference alluded to.\u201d\n\nThen there was this interjection, when Wallace wasn\u2019t even talking to Trump at all:\n\nWallace: Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events\u2014 Trump: Nobody will show up. Nobody shows up to his rallies.\n\nGreat; thanks for adding that, president of the United States! When Biden was talking about his son Beau, who is dead, having served in Iraq, Trump interrupted to note that \u201cHunter Biden was thrown out [of the military] because of cocaine use.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Biden, Trump concluded his thoughts about election integrity by declaring that the United States is not capable of counting ballots and holding an election. \u201cYou know that it cannot be done,\u201d the president said to Chris Wallace, about the orderly transition of democratic power.\n\nOur government is a disaster is a tricky message for an incumbent president to try to win with. And having just seen Trump blast his way through the floorboards and sub-basement of the debate \u201cexpectations game,\u201d ending up gurgling and hollering in the sewers, it was not very reassuring to hear him predict that the election itself will go even worse.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:26.474601", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 06:31:52.230000+00:00", "publish_time": "06:31:52", "source": "slate", "title": "Trump-Biden debate: the challenger talked to America, the president talked to a right-wing Facebook comments section.", "topics": ["trump", "trumpbiden", "racial", "states", "president", "voters", "united", "rightwing", "america", "talked", "challenger", "biden", "wallace", "trumps", "comments", "debate", "facebook", "election"]}
