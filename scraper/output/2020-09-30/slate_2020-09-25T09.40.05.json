{"authors": ["Rachelle Hampton"], "body": "In August of last year, a romance novelist named Courtney Milan tweeted a series of screenshots from a 1999 romance novel called Somewhere Lies the Moon. In those passages, Kathryn Lynn Davis, the book\u2019s white author, describes her Chinese characters\u2019 \u201cslanted almond eyes\u201d and \u201cbronze faces, turned slightly yellow by the London climate.\u201d Milan wrote: \u201cAs a half-Chinese person with brown eyes, seriously fuck this piece of shit.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Milan got an email informing her that two formal ethics complaints had been filed against her with the Romance Writers of America, an organization whose members include some 9,000 published and aspiring romance authors. One came from Davis, who was accusing Milan of \u201ccyberbullying\u201d and alleging that her tweets had cost Davis a publishing contract; the other came from Suzan Tisdale, a white romance writer who runs a small publishing company where Davis worked as an editor. Months passed with no word. Milan told only a few people the details of the ongoing investigation. One of those was another romance novelist: her friend Alyssa Cole.\n\nCole is intimately familiar with the ways the romance community\u2019s largely white gatekeepers have resisted making the genre more inclusive. Her 2017 historical romance An Extraordinary Union, about a former slave modeled on an actual Black Civil War spy, was one of the most popular romance novels that year, even garnering praise from mainstream critics\u2014a rare feat for a genre that tends to be siloed into the realm of guilty pleasure. But An Extraordinary Union wasn\u2019t even nominated for one of the RWA\u2019s own annual awards. All the finalists in the historical romance category that year were white women, all but one of whom had written books where the swoony male heroes were 19th-century British aristocrats. At the time, no Black author had ever won, in any category, since the organization started giving awards in 1982. Cole\u2019s snub prompted its own blowback\u2014first a flood of tweets from romance writers of color about the diversity issues they\u2019d faced in the industry and then what felt like a hollow pledge from the RWA board to do better.\n\nCole was one of the first people to know when, two days before Christmas in 2019, the RWA judgment on Courtney Milan came in. Milan was found guilty of violating the \u201cassociation\u2019s express purpose of creating a \u2018safe and respectful environment\u2019 for its community of writers.\u201d Despite the RWA\u2019s own code of ethics outlining that \u201cnon-RWA-operated social media posts\u201d and \u201chonest discussions of books and similar writing\u201d were not valid grounds for complaints, Milan had been formally censured; her membership was suspended for one year, and she was banned from holding leadership positions in the future. Cole felt she couldn\u2019t stay silent. \u201cI just left my body with rage,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t want her friend to have to shoulder the burden of speaking out alone. So, with Milan\u2019s permission, she leaked the judgment from the RWA\u2019s ethics committee on Twitter. What followed was an explosive reckoning over racism in the world of romance writing, one that threatened to tear the community apart. For Cole, whose romances often deal with white backlash to racial progress, the blowup was nothing less than \u201cAmerica in miniature.\u201d\n\nRoosters crow in the background as Cole and I sip coffee together in our respective homes, some 2,000 miles apart. Cole and her husband have lived in Martinique since 2014; they moved into their current house on a rural part of the island three years ago, and the chickens have been around ever since.\n\nCole followed her husband, who is French, to the Caribbean after a meet cute worthy of a romance novel: They met at a mutual friend\u2019s brunch in 2012, two weeks after Cole was dumped by someone else, and she assumed he didn\u2019t like her because he wasn\u2019t talking much. (In reality, it was because he couldn\u2019t understand her fast-paced English.) \u201cShe\u2019s sort of like the awkward romance heroine who has chickens running through her yard and trips over things,\u201d said Milan. It\u2019s in this house, surrounded by chickens, where Cole wrote her new book When No One Is Watching\u2014her debut thriller and her first official foray outside of romance.\n\nAs a kid, Cole would buy tabloid romances and use Wite-Out to change the descriptions of ivory or pale skin to brown.\n\nWhen No One Is Watching, released earlier this month, is being marketed as Rear Window meets Get Out; it\u2019s a story about sinister forces behind the gentrification of a Brooklyn neighborhood. Cole has long been interested in the intersection of dreamy romance and real-world drama. Her first series of full-length novels, 2015\u2019s Off the Grid, was a trilogy of post-apocalyptic romances that follows a multiracial group fighting to survive after the electrical power goes out. Since then, Cole\u2019s romances have been set during the civil rights movement and the Revolutionary War, in medieval Scotland and 1917 Harlem, all dramatic backdrops for her heroines\u2014mostly Black women\u2014who retain and assert their agency, even if they exist in a time period where all the forces around them are designed to deprive them of it. In 2018, she published the first book in her Reluctant Royals series, a string of delicious contemporary romps through international palaces, all starring Black heroines. It landed on the New York Times\u2019 list of 100 notable books that year.\n\nGrowing up in the Bronx and Jersey City, Cole\u2019s early literary favorites included Anne Rice and Stephen King. She found herself most fixated on how relationships formed on page and on screen, especially in stories that had happy endings\u2014even if they didn\u2019t include people who looked like her.\n\nHer parents worked to make sure she was also surrounded by books that reflected the reality of the neighborhoods where she grew up\u2014books by authors like Octavia Butler and Toni Morrison, and fairy tales that featured illustrations of people who looked like her. But even as books written by diverse authors were scattered around the house, the romances Cole\u2019s mother owned mostly featured white characters written by white authors. As a kid, Cole would buy tabloid romances at supermarkets and use Wite-Out to alter the descriptions of ivory or pale skin, changing them to brown. \u201cMy career on some level is making sure people don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d she said. She was 11 when she read her first romance novel, Sandra Kitt\u2019s The Color of Love, starring a Black graphic designer. For Cole, who also aspired to be a comic book artist at the time, it was a lightning rod moment, the first time she didn\u2019t have to mentally or literally sub out the author\u2019s descriptions in order to see herself.\n\nCole\u2019s love of romance persisted into adulthood, when, while working as a production editor of a science journal in Brooklyn, she started reading Smart Bitches, Trashy Books, a website founded in 2005 that\u2019s dedicated to dissecting romance novels, and realized there was a wider community that shared her tastes. Suddenly, Cole felt inspired to try writing romance herself. \u201cI like reading these kinds of books. There are other people who like reading these kinds of books,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cIf I sit down and write a whole book, maybe someone will want to read it.\u201d\n\nBut romance bloggers weren\u2019t her only source of inspiration. Cole found the seeds of several of her historical romances in a more unlikely place: Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 blog, which she began following around 2008, when he was writing on comic books. As Coates began to write more about history\u2014including the Freedom Riders and Black Civil War spies\u2014Cole found herself asking two questions: 1) Why don\u2019t more people know about this? and 2) What if there were kissing involved?\n\nBlack historical fiction usually evokes one of two emotions in readers: pathos or pity. There is little room for the full range of emotion Black people experienced, no matter the time period. Even in the most horrific circumstances, of course Black people fell in love. And Cole felt sure that those stories deserved to be told\u2014not to romanticize the past but to tell the full truth of how we built lives despite this country\u2019s best efforts to take them from us.\n\nNot long after Cole began reading Coates\u2019 blog, she started publishing in various small presses. Then, in 2015, her sci-fi romance trilogy Off the Grid was picked up through a Twitter pitch contest run through Carina, the digital arm of Harlequin. In 2016, Cole found an agent with the manuscript of An Extraordinary Union, which eventually landed on the desk of Esi Sogah, a senior editor at Kensington. According to the annual State of Racial Diversity in Romance Publishing report published by the Ripped Bodice, the West Coast\u2019s sole romance-only bookstore, Kensington was one of two publishers whose publication list included more than 20 percent authors of color in 2019.* (Carina is the other.) \u201cI don\u2019t think [An Extraordinary Union] would have been published if there was not a Black editor at Kensington at that time who was willing to\u2014I don\u2019t want to say \u2018take a risk,\u2019 because the book was good,\u201d Cole tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be egotistical. A lot of times when it comes to talking about books by Black authors, it\u2019s like, \u2018This person took a chance on me.\u2019 Well, they take a chance with every book, but only people from marginalized groups are supposed to act all grateful and as if we\u2019re not making money for the publisher. Esi liked it. She advocated for it. They decided to publish it.\u201d\n\nCole found herself asking: 1) Why don\u2019t more people know about this history? and 2) What if there were kissing involved?\n\nFor many years, the only entry points into the romance industry for Black authors were specific imprints targeted at Black audiences, like Harlequin\u2019s Kimani, which announced in 2017 that it was ceasing publication. According to novelist Beverly Jenkins, the grande dame of Black romance, it wasn\u2019t until Black authors began publishing their books through independent presses or selling their e-books on Amazon that the industry sat up and took notice of the money it was leaving on the table. \u201cThe [women who published independently], I think, made a real difference in how Black writers and Black readers were perceived,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201c[That helped change] publishing\u2019s minds that maybe they need to start doing business differently.\u201d For the majority of Jenkins\u2019 30-year career, she was the only novelist writing Black historical romances with a major publisher\u2014not because others didn\u2019t want to but because, she says, editors were convinced that Black women didn\u2019t read.\n\nNow, major publishing houses regularly release books by Black romance writers, though the numbers remain very low\u2014less than 10 percent of romance novels released by a leading publisher in 2019 were written by an author of color. (Cole has been published by HarperCollins since 2018\u2019s A Princess in Theory.) The industry seems to very slowly be coming to terms with the fact that the person most likely to read a book in any format is a college-educated Black woman, a statistic that both Cole and Jenkins cited to me with the weary ease of someone long used to having to do so. The runaway success of authors like Jasmine Guillory, whose 2018 romance The Proposal was a New York Times bestseller, will hopefully turn the tide even faster.\n\nThough the genre\u2019s image in mainstream culture still evokes housewives furtively thumbing through mass-market paperbacks with Fabio on the cover and euphemisms for genitalia within, those stereotypes bear little resemblance to the $1 billion powerhouse industry as it exists today. Cole\u2019s ascendance as a star is just one example of how romance\u2014which accounts for 23 percent of the U.S. fiction market\u2014has progressed past the lily-white days of yore. But the implosion of Romance Writers of America shows just how far the industry still has to go.\n\nShortly after Cole tweeted about Courtney Milan\u2019s reprimand from the RWA ethics committee, #IStandWithCourtney started trending on Twitter. Heavyweights of the genre threw their support behind Milan, including bestselling romance novelist Nora Roberts. The judgment against Milan was reversed and the organization canceled its annual awards ceremony, the Rita awards, after hundreds of authors pulled out in protest and threatened not to renew their memberships. A petition seeking the resignation of the RWA\u2019s then-president, Damon Suede, began circulating online. (In response to a request for comment, Suede said in part: \u201cI have no feelings about Alyssa Cole leaking the documents she did. I am well aware that many people have identified me as a convenient target because I present as a white cis male. \u2026 I fully support all honest reportage, but I am weary of carrying blame for events enacted by other people.\u201d)\n\nIn the spring, a new board of directors issued an apology to Milan and announced that they would be renaming the Rita awards in honor of the organization\u2019s founder Vivian Stephens, a Black woman. (The writer whose book Milan tweeted about, Kathryn Lynn Davis, did not respond to a request for comment. But she told the New York Times in December that she would not have filed a complaint if Milan had been more \u201cprofessional.\u201d) To Cole, the cultural and media response to the controversy has misunderstood its stakes. \u201cI think people try to make it into just about Courtney,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just RWA versus Courtney. It was RWA versus the idea of Courtney and what Courtney represented, which was a pledge for diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the book would have been published if there was not a Black editor at the publishing house.\u201d \u2014 Alyssa Cole\n\nIn many ways, the RWA scandal was an early harbinger\u2014one of the first sparks of the racial reckoning that spread like wildfire across so many industries in the wake of this summer\u2019s protests. But to many within the romance community, the changes prompted by this blowup feel long overdue. Vivian Stephens, who co-founded the organization in 1980, explained in a recent Texas Monthly interview that she left when it became clear that her white RWA colleagues were more interested in creating a social club that hosted lavish parties than in actually changing the face of the publishing industry. She offered to act as an adviser when it became clear that the organization\u2019s leadership had little idea how to\u2014or will to\u2014engage with the frustrations of their increasingly diverse membership. No one took her up on it.\n\nCole has long found that white readers displace their discomfort with her books by nitpicking for grammar errors or suggesting that her stories are unrealistic\u2014while the billionth story by a white author of a duke marrying a maid does not receive the same scrutiny. And some readers are very clear that historical romance about slavery is not the kind of fantasy they\u2019re looking for. \u201cIt was so uncomfortable for me \u2026 that I know I\u2019ll never be able to reread it, and that\u2019s my criteria for a five star review,\u201d said one Goodreads commenter about Cole\u2019s A Hope Divided, which is set during the Civil War. But when Cole and writers like her include racism in their romances, it\u2019s not to make white readers uncomfortable or to ruin the escapism associated with a genre that, by definition, must end happily. Leaving the realities of life as a Black woman on the cutting room floor isn\u2019t escapism to those who experience them\u2014it is erasure. \u201cPeople just want to write love stories,\u201d Cole told me, her voice breaking with frustration. And yet in the face of so many structural challenges, she\u2019s found that the very act of writing about Black romance inevitably feels political. \u201cYou literally have to become an activist to write a story about two people meeting and falling in love,\u201d she said. She\u2019s fighting, in her words, the \u201cingrained resistance to the idea of a Black woman in a stable relationship that is indicative of love\u2014not of sex, of love.\u201d\n\nCole hasn\u2019t abandoned romance for good. The first book in her new Runaway Royals series comes out in December and sparks fly between the two main characters in When No One Is Watching. But her temporary departure from the genre was certainly inspired in part by the frustrations of working within it. She recalls the anger that built as she approached the end of An Unconditional Freedom and realized that, as much as she wanted to, she couldn\u2019t actually kill off Confederate leader Jefferson Davis. Alongside the bone-deep rage that comes with knowing the sheer horrors Black people have faced in America was her knowledge that one act wouldn\u2019t change the past. Assassinating Davis would just feel like a cheap, superficial swipe at historical revisionism when the real evils were far bigger than one bad man.\n\nAnd so Cole\u2019s new thriller When No One Is Watching deals with the cycles of racism that define American history\u2014cycles that directly contradict the idea that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice. There\u2019s a moment early on in the book when the protagonist, a Black Brooklyn native, finds herself on a tour of her own gentrifying neighborhood. Her exchanges with the white tour guide are tense, especially when she interrupts to supplement the details of \u201cthe lives of rich white people who lived there a hundred years ago\u201d with details about the lives of Black people who lived there more recently\u2014and were pushed out to make room for a new set of rich white people, all part of the cycle of white flight and redlining, disinvestment and gentrification. As the tour guide waves the group onward, the protagonist laughs to herself that \u201cannoying people with history they don\u2019t want to acknowledge is kind of fun.\u201d That line might as well be describing Cole\u2019s whole career. \u201cI try not to be the characters that I write, but that\u2019s basically my artist statement,\u201d Cole laughs.\n\nCole\u2019s decision to leak the RWA documents can also be read as part of her general commitment to \u201cannoying\u201d people with history they might not want to acknowledge. It\u2019s a commitment that seems to bond together a new generation of Black romance writers, from Cole to Vanessa Riley to Jasmine Guillory to Piper Huguley, who are writing Black women who don\u2019t have to be inhumanly strong in order to be loved. That new generation, Jenkins told me, allows her to no longer be \u201cworried about the state of African American romance going forward. I consider them all my nieces. My life would be a lot poorer without them.\u201d\n\nTo Cole, writing thrillers and romance novels is not as different as it might seem. When you\u2019re telling a love story, \u201cyou still have to create a tension and suspense,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really have to make the readers think that the couple is not going to get together at the end, even though they picked up the book because the couple is going to get together at the end.\u201d And while When No One Is Watching doesn\u2019t end with the dismantling of systemic oppression, it still\u2014without giving away any details\u2014gets as close to one of her beloved happy endings as it can. \u201cSometimes, you just want some catharsis,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI just want the kind of media white [readers] have been getting for their entire lives.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Sept. 25, 2020: This piece originally misstated that the Ripped Bodice is the U.S.\u2019s sole romance-only bookstore.
