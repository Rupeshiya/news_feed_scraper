{"authors": ["Aymann Ismail"], "body": "OK. I was not sure Joe Biden said it, but it sounded like he did. To a lot of us.\n\nIn the first presidential debate, there was the refusal to disavow white supremacy, and the \u201cJust shut up, man\u201d\u2013style zingers, but if you are Muslim, you were totally distracted by this moment right here:\n\nSomeone PLEASE tell me if you hear Biden saying InshaAllah here... pic.twitter.com/nuuIYnjCSs \u2014 Aymann Ismail (@aymanndotcom) September 30, 2020\n\nThe moderator, Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, had cornered Donald Trump, forcing him to answer for what the New York Times found in his tax returns. Trump lied about how much he paid in federal taxes for 2016 and 2017, and said he\u2019ll release his taxes eventually.\n\nBiden and Trump were talking at the same time, and then it sounded like Biden said: \u201cWhen? Inshallah?\u201d\n\nArabic Twitter lit up immediately. Enough of us tilted our heads, unsure if we heard him say one of our most common phrases. Nobody could say for sure that he said it, but they wanted to believe.\n\nI have left debate twitter and entered inshallah twitter \u2014 Sarah Parvini (\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627) (@sarahparvini) September 30, 2020\n\ndid Biden say \u201cInshAllah\u201d after asking \u201cWhen?\u201d indicating the proper use of InshAllah as meaning \u201cnever\u201d? what in the cultural literacy \u2014 Sana Saeed (@SanaSaeed) September 30, 2020\n\nNow that Biden said \u201cinshallah\u201d Trump needs to top it with \u201cbrother asked a beautiful question\u201d \u2014 Jeremy McLellan (@JeremyMcLellan) September 30, 2020\n\nYes, Joe Biden said \"Inshallah\" during the #Debates2020 debate. It literally means \"God willing,\" but it's often used to mean, \"Yeah, never going to happen.\"\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nMy wife: Will you finally pick up your socks?\n\n\n\nMe: Inshallah.\n\n\n\nNo, saying inshallah doesn't make you Muslim. \u2014 Wajahat \"Wears a Mask Because of a Pandemic\" Ali (@WajahatAli) September 30, 2020\n\nWhoever\u2019s writing that op-ed about feeling seen because Biden said \u201cinshallah\u201d I urge you to spare your community the embarrassment please \ud83d\ude29 \u2014 Asad \u0623\u0633\u062f (@DandiaAsad) September 30, 2020\n\nIf he did say it, he used it perfectly. Inshallah is an Arabic phrase that means \u201cGod willing.\u201d A Muslim would say this as often as a typical white American might say \u201cI hope,\u201d but Arab Christians are known to use it too. If you grew up Muslim, Arabic speaking or not, you\u2019d know it best as the thing your parents say like a gentle-sneaky no. You\u2019d ask your parents to buy you a skateboard or a guitar, and not taking you seriously, they\u2019d say Inshallah. They\u2019re telling you eventually or, in most cases, never. It\u2019s amorphous in this way, and really changes in meaning the way you say it. I\u2019d say it fits pretty well in Biden\u2019s purported use.\n\nCould Biden have said something else? Yes. I saw multiple possibilities from naysayers. Did it seem likely he said something else? Maybe. But Muslims on Twitter chose to believe it because it was funny to. He tacked it on to the end of his dig at Trump the same way my parents would if I asked about that guitar: \u201cWhen? Inshallah?\u201d\n\nFar-right media also seems to have believed it too. Breitbart immediately blogged Biden\u2019s supposed turn of phrase, quoting one writer saying there\u2019s no reason to \u201cfear\u201d the term. The top comment on the site\u2019s post when I checked it said Biden was \u201cpandering to Islam.\u201d I wish.\n\nI reached out to the Biden camp to ask whether or not he really said it. Not too long after, I saw Asma Khalid of NPR had the scoop:\n\nOkay, for those of you wondering - did Joe Biden really drop an \u201cinshallah\u201d with the appropriate sarcastic usage?\n\n\n\nYes, he did. I confirmed with his campaign - that is indeed what the man said. https://t.co/MqseBsl2Ck \u2014 Asma Khalid (@asmamk) September 30, 2020\n\nThis raises only more questions\u2014who taught him!?
