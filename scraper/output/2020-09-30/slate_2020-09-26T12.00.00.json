I had to beg him to propose, but he seemed happy about it. But any time I bring up wedding planning, he brushes me off and says we\u2019ll talk about it later. (He\u2019s been doing this for four years.) Now he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t see the point in getting married because we\u2019ve been together for so long. I\u2019m dying to get married. I\u2019ve tried to express this, and he says he understands but he\u2019s just not ready. I think the next step is an ultimatum, because I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll choose marriage over breaking up (this is how he proposed). Part of the problem is that his best friend, Matt, is constantly in his ear telling him not to marry me so they can stay bachelors. Another issue is that I rely on my boyfriend financially. I would be homeless if I left him, and I don\u2019t want to work. Do I stick around and wait for him to decide he wants to get married, or do I force him to get rid of Matt and take me to the altar?\n\n\u2014Stuck, Again\n\nYou would also be homeless if your boyfriend left you, which is worth considering before committing to this relationship as a career plan. Moreover, I cannot advise you to deliver an ultimatum you\u2019re neither able nor willing to carry out. Being \u201cpretty sure\u201d your boyfriend won\u2019t break up with you over a second ultimatum doesn\u2019t seem like a solid bet. What if he does break up with you? Even if you two do get married, how will you support yourself if you get divorced? If he dies young? If he gets sick or injured and is unable to keep working? What\u2019s your contingency plan if things don\u2019t go the way you expect, bearing in mind that life very rarely goes according to your blueprint (including this relationship, which has not gone according to plan for the past few years)? At the very least, you should have a savings account in your own name that will cover transit to get you to family or friends should you need to find another place to stay on short notice. I\u2019d also encourage you to look for part-time or freelance work so you can start building a more robust cushion\u2014not because you\u2019re planning on dumping your boyfriend tomorrow, but because you should know that you can keep a roof over your head no matter how your romantic relationship is doing.\n\nAs for your question about Matt\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure how you propose to force your boyfriend to get rid of him, especially since you\u2019ve spent the last four years trying to maintain an engagement your erstwhile fianc\u00e9 now seems to consider over. He\u2019s managed to bargain you down from \u201cfine, we\u2019re engaged\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s too late to get married, and I\u2019m not ready, so let\u2019s downgrade back to dating\u201d without any real consequences, so I\u2019m not optimistic about your chances. You and I may simply have different priorities, and you certainly don\u2019t have to conduct your personal life according to my values, but I wonder what you\u2019re getting out of this relationship, with a man who finds your goals exasperating, who\u2019s happy to let you \u201cbeg\u201d for an engagement only to announce years later that he doesn\u2019t really feel like getting married after all, whose goodwill you rely on in order to support yourself financially, and who discusses with his best friend how great it is not to be married. What\u2019s in this for you?\n\nHelp! My Relatives Call Every Day to Beg Me to Save My Abusive Dad\u2019s Life.\n\nDanny M. Lavery is joined by Emily VanDerWerff on this week\u2019s episode of the Dear Prudence podcast.\n\nSubscribe to the Dear Prudence Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband comes from an extended family of racist right-wingers, although he has switched political parties since being with me. Historically, I have bitten my tongue for the sake of family harmony, but I feel it\u2019s my duty to confront racism when I see it. His grandparents and parents keep posting ignorant, racist things to social media. I asked my husband if I could respond, and he requested I refrain (again for the sake of family harmony). I feel like if I\u2019m not supporting the solution, I\u2019m part of the problem, but I also want to respect my husband\u2019s wishes. What should I do?\n\n\u2014Racist Peace Isn\u2019t Peaceful\n\nYour husband\u2019s wishes are for you to keep your mouth shut when his relatives publish racist screeds because he doesn\u2019t want to quarrel with them about their racism. He would like to make their expressions of racism more convenient and comfortable, and he wants you to either pretend to agree with them or not to have seen them in the first place, in order to achieve that goal. Such wishes do not merit your respect, and I cannot advise you to keep honoring them. You can love your husband very much and be honest about how wrong he is in this matter. Just because the racists in question happen to be your husband\u2019s relatives doesn\u2019t mean you should defer to him or let him take the lead. When they say or do something racist, whether in person or through social media, challenge it. If that makes your husband uncomfortable, so much the better. He is entirely too comfortable with racism, and it will do him a world of good to be discomfited.\n\nGet Prudie in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

It was not, I will admit, my best work. But we were on track to finish in time when, at the end of an already hostile meeting, the client thought the call had ended and said about me to her co-worker, \u201cShe\u2019s a fucking asshole.\u201d He responded jokingly, \u201cYou guys are gonna fight.\u201d I said, \u201cFYI, I can still hear you,\u201d and hung up. After that, she sent a series of emails to both my company and hers claiming that I refused to do my job.\n\nThe problem is this is a client and not a co-worker. The harassment continues even today. She apologized for \u201cmaking anyone feel bad, and for what some might have interpreted as jarring.\u201d I told my boss I considered this both slander and harassment. She said she\u2019s handling it with the client. I have created a filter so that I don\u2019t have to see the emails anymore because they were affecting me emotionally. I had to schedule a meeting with my therapist to process. I told my boss it\u2019s affecting my productivity. I\u2019m not sure what else to do. I\u2019m not allowed to talk to this client anymore. She\u2019s not going to apologize, and she continues to slander me and has now possibly moved on to doing so to other clients of mine. I have been at this job for 10 years, and I have certainly had unhappy clients before, but no one has ever been this malicious. Any advice? I\u2019ve tried to find other jobs in the past, but I need to work from home because of a disability, and this job gives me that option. But emotionally I can\u2019t continue to be harassed by this person and accused of failing to do my job.\n\n\u2014Not an Asshole\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree with your definition of harassment. If your former client were still emailing you after you\u2019d already left the project, saying over and over again that you were a lousy employee, I might have a different answer. Or if those emails you\u2019ve had to filter aren\u2019t simply a back-and-forth between your co-workers and this client as they finish this project but an ongoing series of insults about your competence and your character, then you have the right to ask your boss to intervene. But if you consider a one-time, half-hearted (and, yes, insincere) apology like \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making anyone feel bad\u201d to be both slander and harassment, I think you\u2019re going to have a hard time getting anyone else to share those definitions.\n\nYou say this woman has \u201cpossibly moved on\u201d to complaining about you to other clients, which makes me wonder if you know this for sure or merely suspect it. And if what she\u2019s saying is that she doesn\u2019t like you and had a bad time working with you (you say you didn\u2019t give her your best work and that tensions ran high during your meetings), that\u2019s not slander, just her opinion and experience. It may be frustrating, and you certainly don\u2019t have to like it or agree with it, but I think the best way to move on is to do just that. Focus on your other projects, continue to speak to your therapist about it, and keep your distance from this woman. If she\u2019s still contacting you directly to berate you even after you\u2019ve stopped speaking to her, or if you know her to be exaggerating or lying about your work, then you can ask your boss (or HR if your boss is too conflict-avoidant) to intervene, but beyond that, your options are limited.\n\nCatch up on this week\u2019s Prudie.\n\nNow available in your podcast player: the audiobook edition of Danny M.

I do not trust men to answer me honestly about their status, and I know some men may not even know if they have an STD. My motto is better safe than sorry, so I stay at home, alone. I get by with sex toys, but I so wish for physical contact. So sad when the skin craves love.
