{"authors": ["Mia Armstrong"], "body": "Anti-aircraft guns in London during the Blitz of 1940 were mostly for show. It was extremely difficult to shoot down an aircraft. The shells launched to explode in an enemy bomber\u2019s flight path had to be timed to one-fortieth of a second, explained Future Tense fellow Jamie Holmes in a recent online event co-sponsored by Future Tense and Issues in Science and Technology.* A timing device a second off would mean an explosion 2,000 feet from its intended target.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that at the start of the Blitz it took about 20,000 shells to shoot down a single airplane.\n\nDeveloping a solution to the problem\u2014an electronic sensor within a shell that could detect a nearby aircraft and blow up in its proximity\u2014was simple in theory but complicated in execution, Holmes said. The electronics of the day were extremely sensitive, the transistor didn\u2019t yet exist, and any sensor would have to withstand enormous pressure. The task of creating the first \u201c \u2018intelligent\u2019 bullet,\u201d Holmes writes, was thus akin to \u201cshooting a light bulb out of a pistol.\u201d\n\nThe story of the rag-tag group of Americans who took on this challenge, \u201cone of the toughest, most urgent scientific tasks of World War II,\u201d is the center of Holmes\u2019 new book, 12 Seconds of Silence: How a Team of Inventors, Tinkerers, and Spies Took Down a Nazi Superweapon.\n\nThis team of scientists, led by Merle Tuve and known as Section T of the Office of Science and Research Development, went from working on a borrowed Virginia farm and buying the wrong blasting powder to creating the world\u2019s first \u201csmart\u201d weapon, itself key to Allied victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of cooperation and overcoming scientific puzzles under great pressure,\u201d Holmes said, explaining why he was drawn to the subject. Or, as he wrote in a Future Tense piece: It\u2019s a story of \u201chow to organize science in an emergency against a ticking clock.\u201d\n\nSound familiar?\n\nToday, the threats we face\u2014a pandemic, climate change, cyberattacks\u2014are less visible than Nazi bombs and drones raining from the sky.\n\nThreats such as low-grade cyberwarfare and intellectual property theft in particular are hard to rally against, because they are \u201cmost obvious in channels that are very classified and sensitive,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Robert Schmidle (ret.), the university adviser on cyber capabilities and conflict studies at Arizona State University as well as a cyberfellow at the school\u2019s Center on the Future of War. A major challenge, said Schmidle, who formerly served as first deputy commander within the U.S. Cyber Command, \u201cis trying to incentivize the electorate and the industrial base to do work for the government when you are asking, in some cases, for them just to press the \u2018I believe\u2019 button.\u201d\n\nThe bonds between the military, the academy, and industry that were forged during World War II form the basis of the military-industrial-knowledge complex. Those bonds were made closer and more permanent by government spending on science and technology during the Cold War, and are now being tested by a number of factors\u2014lack of leadership, increased globalization, decreased incentives and legitimate moral concerns on the part of individuals being pressed into service.\n\nBack in WWII days, there was no doubt that companies like General Motors were subservient to the national interest. But nowadays, \u201cglobalization has escalated such that it can be hard to define the nationality of a corporation,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Martinez, the editorial director of Future Tense.\n\nCompanies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, \u201cin many cases behave as if they were nation states,\u201d agreed Schmidle.\n\nWhile the military-industrial-knowledge complex has resulted in innovation\u2014and indeed fueled the growth of Silicon Valley and an \u201cextraordinary set of commercial technologies\u201d such as GPS and the internet itself \u2014it has also brought mistakes and tragedies, said Margaret O\u2019Mara, the author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America. The resulting question is \u201cHow can we think about a next-generation partnership that prioritizes a broader public good?\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cindustry is an important partner to certain parts of the government,\u201d O\u2019Mara said, \u201cit can\u2019t be the agenda-setter.\u201d Governments need to develop their capacities to become better partners, recognizing that the most important piece of any partnership is the people.\n\nScientists and technologists need a mission to do their best work, said O\u2019Mara, who serves as the Howard & Frances Keller Endowed Professor of History at the University of Washington. Complex politics, interrelated tech, and integrated supply chains make it harder for today\u2019s scientists and technologists to \u201cfigure out what\u2019s the right stance to have\u201d when it comes to working with the government, she said. Those who do choose to work in science and technology development for the government \u201cdo so for the mission, not the money,\u201d Schmidle said.\n\nU.S. immigration and education policies will also make or break the future of national innovation.\n\n\u201cThe Americans do not have a monopoly on technological talent. The reason that the U.S. has been such a powerhouse is because of immigration policy, foreign educational exchange, and an investment in higher ed,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cLooking at this historically, those are foundational.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Merle Tuve\u2019s team settled on a radio proximity fuse, which would prove crucial to fighting against the V-1, the Nazis\u2019 deadly drones deployed late in the war, which struck terror among Londoners with both their whirling travel sound and the 12 seconds of silence that accompanied their final descent to impact.\n\nAs Holmes documents, Office of Science and Research Development Director Vannevar Bush\u2019s vision of mobilizing science for the war effort led to the development and deployment not only of the fuse, but also of Allied landing craft, a blood substitute, penicillin, and radar-jamming technology, to name just a few of the innovations from \u201cBush\u2019s army of researchers\u201d within the OSRD.\n\nFor Holmes, the OSRD\u2019s path to success offers lessons for contemporary efforts to leverage science and technology in the national interest.\n\nBush believed that \u201cin order to come up with radical innovations, you need to go back to basics,\u201d Holmes said. Balancing the timeless tension between the need for basic and applied research, the government set some parameters of priorities, but granted scientists autonomy to conduct their research as they saw fit. The OSRD was arranged so that the government would hold patents derived from researchers\u2019 work, and designed in order to foster connections between \u201cpeople who aren\u2019t used to talking to each other,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, as Holmes wrote for Future Tense in August, Bush and Tuve left us with the lesson \u201cthat administrative wisdom can be profoundly heroic. \u2026 [I]t\u2019s not just relying on science but the intelligent organization of science that often matters most.\u201d\n\n*Correction, Sept. 25, 2020: This article originally misspelled Jamie Holmes\u2019 first name.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:31.244541", "publish_date": "2020-09-25", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-25 19:03:15.991000+00:00", "publish_time": "19:03:15", "source": "slate", "title": "History\u2019s lessons for science and technology during COVID-19.", "topics": ["science", "lessons", "war", "holmes", "work", "tense", "historys", "research", "university", "technology", "future", "covid19", "omara"]}
