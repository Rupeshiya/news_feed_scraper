{"authors": ["Aaron Mak"], "body": "Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden repeatedly devolved into a cacophony\u2014mostly due to Trump\u2019s apparent strategy to interrupt and browbeat Biden as much as possible. The former vice president, meanwhile, seemed to borrow his strategy from Jim Halpert from The Office, often looking straight to the camera in exasperation as Trump yelled. In some of the most chaotic moments, a frustrated Biden snapped at Trump, to his face, in a way the president has rarely experienced in public for the past four years.\n\nHere are the best Biden one-liners of the night, in no particular order:\n\n\u201cJust shut up, man.\u201d\n\nBiden told Trump twice to zip it. The first instance occurred when Trump tried pressuring Biden into divulging whether he\u2019d support ending the filibuster or packing the court. The second time came when Trump interjected \u201ctell that to Nancy Pelosi,\u201d as Biden was outlining his reopening plan for businesses. (#JustShutUpMan quickly, inevitably, became a hashtag.)\n\n\"Will you just shush for a minute?\" -- Biden to Trump as he keeps interrupting him pic.twitter.com/AbBabfl5Qm \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 30, 2020\n\nBREAKING VIDEO: \u201cJust shut up man,\u201d Biden says as Trump interrupts him. #Debates2020 pic.twitter.com/94WCHTDe0R \u2014 Anoncat \u262d\u2602\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4 \u2790 (@anoncatanoncat) September 30, 2020\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get any word in with this clown.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden was criticizing Trump\u2019s record on trade deficits, the president again derailed the debate by bringing up Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business activities. Biden, whom moderator Chris Wallace had given the last word on the issue, got fed up at yet another interruption.\n\nBiden: \u2018It\u2019s hard to get any word in with this clown\u2019\n\n\n\nEnd this debate. It's completely pointless.\n\nTrump refuses to answer questions and just screams over everyone, argues with the moderator, lies every time he opens his mouth.#Debates2020 pic.twitter.com/LBjBwYNe6U \u2014 Holly Figueroa O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) September 30, 2020\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst president America has ever had, come on.\u201d\n\nWhile the two candidates were litigating each other\u2019s records in office, Biden cut right to the chase.\n\nMOMENT\n\n\n\nBiden: \u201cYou\u2019re the worst president America has ever had, come on.\n\n\n\nTrump: \u201cI\u2019ve done more in 47 months than you\u2019ve done in 47 years, Joe.\u201d https://t.co/NIYsIbTxhw#Debates2020 pic.twitter.com/eyzUUaUpM1 \u2014 Dan Linden (@DanLinden) September 30, 2020\n\n\u201c \u2018It is what it is\u2019 because you are who you are.\u201d\n\nBiden turned Trump\u2019s own line against him in an exchange during the COVID-19 segment of the debate. In an August interview with Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, Trump seemed to shrug off the mounting death toll, saying, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d Biden rattled off a list of statistics as an indictment of Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic: 200,000 deaths total in the U.S.; 40,000 infections a day; and between 750 and 1,000 people dying every day.
