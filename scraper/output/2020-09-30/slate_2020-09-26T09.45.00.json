{"authors": ["Elizabeth Skoski"], "body": "When our daughter was born, my husband went all in on his new role as a #GirlDad. He donned a red bandanna for our family\u2019s Rosie the Riveter costume on her first Halloween, learned the difference between ponytails and pigtails, and talked her through Yankees games, developing elaborate plans to eventually teach her the knuckleball and get her signed to the major leagues. So, I was surprised when, in the middle of the new season of Hulu\u2019s Pen15, my woke-dad husband turned to me and joked that he would be stepping aside and leaving me to handle our daughter\u2019s middle school years.\n\nWoke dads have been multiplying in recent years, both in real life and in popular media. Ludo Gabriele writes a popular blog, Woke Daddy, chronicling his feminist awakenings as he raises a daughter, one among several dads-of-daughters using their platforms to raise awareness of things like the gender divide, toxic masculinity, and unfair household labor distribution. There are even Etsy shops peddling \u201cwoke dad\u201d T-shirts and \u201cmost woke dad ever\u201d coffee mugs. They\u2019ve been joined by fictional counterparts in movies like Juno, To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before, and Eighth Grade, whose emotionally available dads are a sharp and welcome change from the hands-off father figures of yesteryear.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

For years, they\u2019ve been fed a steady diet of the vulgar horrors of male puberty for boys, starting with American Pie and continuing through Superbad. But girls experiencing those years have been mostly ignored, with last year\u2019s Booksmart being a rare outlier. Pen15, created by and starring comics Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, is an exception. Set in the year 2000 and featuring the show\u2019s creators playing their teenage selves, the show aims to depict middle school in a true light, with all the surprise periods, horrible first kisses, and confusing sexual desires. It delves into puberty in an unflinching way that is rarely seen\u2014at least for girls.\n\nWoke dads are invariably depicted as emotionally perceptive, but there\u2019s much less emphasis on helping their daughters understand their own bodies. Crying over a boy or angry at a best friend? These dads are here for you. Want to talk about sex? Well, you\u2019re getting the straightforward messaging that for girls, sex equals unwanted pregnancy. In To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before, Lara Jean\u2019s dad tosses her an envelope of condoms and yells, \u201cPulling out is not protection!\u201d as she flees the car. It\u2019s a sentiment Twitter users noticed echoed another woke dad, who\u2019s also a single gynecologist: Dr. Stratford of 10 Things I Hate About You, strapping a fake pregnancy belly to his daughter, telling her that\u2019s what kissing leads to. It\u2019s abundantly clear that these dads are ready and willing to help their daughters through the emotional minefield of puberty, but even as medical professionals, the physical transformation of their little girls (developing breasts, first periods, oral sex, masturbation) is still too uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say this instinct to shy away is solely these woke dads\u2019 fault. For generations, society has told us that girls\u2019 puberty is something to be hidden. (Kotex still promotes their pads by declaring they have \u201cquiet wrappers for discretion,\u201d and I think every person who menstruates has done the ol\u2019 tampon up the sleeve move). New and exciting sexual urges, including the drive to masturbate, are also typically on the list of forbidden subjects. Pop culture has been comfortable with teen boys pleasuring themselves at least as far back as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but it\u2019s only recently allowed the same for girls.\n\nPen15 was born out of its creators\u2019 desire to discuss exactly those things they were programmed not to talk about: first sexual experiences, masturbating, and periods. In the first season, Maya doesn\u2019t just discover masturbation. She becomes obsessed with it, going so far as to pleasure herself in a bathroom stall at school. Anna doesn\u2019t just have an awkward first kiss; a boy slobbers around her mouth so hard that it leaves a sheen of spit on her chin. The two don\u2019t explore their new bodies, in traditional teen-movie fashion, by shopping for bras. They steal a thong from classmate and swap it back and forth throughout the day.\n\nThat\u2019s why the show is perfect, and crucial viewing, for woke dads. Surging and overwhelming emotions are important, but they are only one side of the puberty coin. The other side is the cringy, and sometimes even icky, reality of living with, and in, a body that is constantly, physically, changing.\n\nSeason 2\u2014the first half, anyway, since the second has been indefinitely delayed by COVID\u2014continues this trajectory, offering man-behind-the-curtain looks at things many adult women can identify with, but that even woke dads may be only peripherally aware of. Maya\u2019s toilet paper-wad solution to an unexpected period hits particularly close to home, as does the girls\u2019 consideration of whether the shape, size, and smell of their own vaginas is normal, after being insulted by a boy for having \u201cBSBs\u2014Big Smelly Bushes.\u201d The moment is both hilarious (\u201cBe careful with it, maybe it doesn\u2019t like that\u201d Anna warns after Maya sprays hers with body spray) and heartbreaking, showing a girl\u2019s first experience with shame towards her own natural body, the kind of shame that so often can follow her into adulthood.\n\nBeyond this, Season 2 also charts vital new territory that reaches beyond the theme of women connecting with and cathartically surviving the traumas of puberty, and invites men to look into and evaluate the behavior of their pasts. Maya\u2019s obsession over a crush who both does and doesn\u2019t reciprocate her feelings shows us a rarely depicted but instantly familiar youthful toxic masculinity, a boy who is not a victim of the expectations of manhood, but instead deliberately chose to contribute to the dehumanization of a girl. It\u2019s reflection all men in our post-#MeToo world should engage in. Outside of self-reflection, the dads of Pen15 behave ways that today\u2019s woke dads might judge harshly. They\u2019re largely absent from their daughters\u2019 lives, and the effects of the purposeful space these dads leave is obvious on their children. Throughout the two seasons, running subplots include Maya\u2019s desperation for attention and approval from her father, a traveling musician, Anna\u2019s increasing distress and pain from being put in the middle of her parents\u2019 messy divorce, culminating with her father explaining that since her mother has been awarded the house, he will be moving to an apartment, and Anna will have to choose who she wants to live with, he says. These arcs generate some extremely touching mother-daughter moments, prompting dads of today to think about how the fathers of Pen15 could have, and should have, done better.\n\nMy husband sometimes repeats words of wisdom from an old baseball coach: \u201cPractice doesn\u2019t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.\u201d As we wrap our binge of Season 2, I remind him of the saying. Pen15 is giving us a rare, truthful glimpse into our daughter\u2019s future, the tumultuous middle school years looming on the horizon, the reality of what she\u2019ll likely experience. It\u2019s some of the most perfect practice an aspiring woke dad can get.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:34.004471", "publish_date": "2020-09-26", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-26 09:45:00+00:00", "publish_time": "09:45:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Pen15: Hulu series is a wake-up call for woke dads who balk at their daughters' adolescence.", "topics": ["puberty", "series", "woke", "dads", "doesnt", "daughters", "girls", "hulu", "balk", "wakeup", "adolescence", "pen15", "perfect", "middle", "dad"]}
