{"authors": ["Shannon Palus"], "body": "The first presidential debate featured a number of COVID-19 precautions. Donald Trump and Joe Biden didn\u2019t shake hands. There were fewer than 100 people in the live audience. Masks were required. Look, here are people wearing masks:\n\nHmm, actually, that video also shows Ivanka Trump sit down with a mask on and then \u2026 take it off. In fact, many of the Trump folks\u2014about half, according to a Bloomberg News reporter who was tweeting from inside the debate hall\u2014are seated, and maskless:\n\nAn observation from inside the debate hall: Everyone in Biden\u2019s side of the hall is wearing a mask. More than half on Trump\u2019s side, including his four children, are not wearing masks. According to the Cleveland Clinic, it\u2019s a requirement that all guests wear masks. \u2014 Tyler Pager (@tylerpager) September 30, 2020\n\nLeading by example pic.twitter.com/i5eqjbn1AN \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) September 30, 2020\n\nAlso those chairs\u2014they\u2019re pretty close together. Some of them are right up against each other. Others are spaced \u2026 a few feet apart? I wasn\u2019t in Cleveland with a tape measurer, and camera angles are tricky, but it certainly does not look like there is 6 feet of space between Lara Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle. Could an adult man of average height fit between them? And what about the guy behind them? The chair setup looks like the \u201cI\u2019m not touching you, I\u2019m not touching you\u201d of COVID precautions.\n\nBut perhaps they were sitting a full 6 feet away from each other, and this is all a trick of the camera. Sitting indoors for an extended period of time without a mask happens to be a great way to spread a virus that travels from one person to another through invisible breath droplets. This is why some experts recommend that you stay even further away from other people, if possible, when indoors. If the virus is cigarette smoke, as the metaphor goes \u2026 would you want to be seated maybe 6 feet away from a maskless Trump child? It\u2019s true that everyone who entered the arena was supposed to be tested ahead of time, and hey\u2014maybe the Trumps and all their friends are in one carefully managed quarantine bubble. That isn\u2019t an excuse to shed the most obvious measure of protection while setting an example on national television.\n\nThe debates took place in a 27,000-square-foot atrium (spacious!) that, according to the Associated Press, was previously on standby as a makeshift hospital, with hundreds of beds at the ready for potential COVID-19 patients. The would-be hospital wasn\u2019t needed because of \u201caggressive public health measures.\u201d I\u2019m sorry to say, at least on Trump\u2019s half of the crowd, the lesson clearly wasn\u2019t learned.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:27.194500", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 06:42:43.910000+00:00", "publish_time": "06:42:43", "source": "slate", "title": "The Trump Family Chose to Watch All of That Maskless and Indoors for Two Hours", "topics": ["maskless", "trump", "masks", "im", "indoors", "feet", "family", "half", "hours", "chose", "wasnt", "trumps", "watch", "debate", "wearing", "mask"]}
