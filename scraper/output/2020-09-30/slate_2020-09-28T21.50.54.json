{"authors": ["Dahlia Lithwick"], "body": "Attacking Amy Coney Barrett, Donald Trump\u2019s nomination to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Supreme Court seat, feels like a third rail. There\u2019s seemingly no way to do it without Democrats getting burned with blowback for being anti-Catholic or unfeminist. On a recent episode of Amicus, in a discussion taped just before Trump officially made his nomination, Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern are joined by the Nation\u2019s justice correspondent Elie Mystal to unpack what\u2019s in play here, and how Democrats should fight this battle. A portion of their discussion, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, is transcribed below.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Does it matter who he names?\n\nMark Joseph Stern: Yeah, it absolutely doesn\u2019t matter who he names because we already know why he has selected this individual. He\u2019s really gone on TV multiple times and stated his chief criterion, which is that he wants a justice who will hand him the presidential election that we are currently in. He has said over and over again that he will not accept a peaceful transfer of power automatically, that he does not believe the election is necessarily being run fairly, and that he will win once the federal judiciary and the Supreme Court make sure that the ballots, by which we think he means mail-in ballots, are not counted, because he thinks mail-in ballots are fraudulent. I mean, really he thinks they\u2019re just cast by Democrats, but what\u2019s the difference to him? So Donald Trump is looking for a Supreme Court nominee who will, in a quite plausible Bush v. Gore\u2013like scenario, automatically rule for him, nullifying as many democratic ballots as necessary to ensure that he receives another term. That is this man\u2019s stated public goal. I could not care less the vessel he chooses for it. This is what he\u2019s doing, and we know why he\u2019s doing it.\n\nElie Mystal: And of course, Mark, he\u2019s not even making the choice really. It wouldn\u2019t matter what Trump wanted because the Republicans, the Federalist Society, the arch-conservatives, they\u2019re the ones making this pick. And they, for a generation, have told us what they want out of this pick. They want a woman to be the person who either ends or significantly eviscerates Roe v. Wade. They want a woman to beard them from the constant accusations of sexism that are rife within their movement. And they want a woman to be the one to extend gun laws and to do all the things conservatives want to do. It does not matter which vessel he picks to do this with.\n\nI wonder if we\u2019re already being set up for a trap in so far as the nominee, as of this taping, hasn\u2019t been selected and I\u2019m getting 10 emails a day blistering me for being anti-Catholic or for being anti-woman. They haven\u2019t picked a nominee yet, and already, apparently, whoever that person is is a victim. And so I\u2019m trying to figure out how, assuming it is a woman or assuming it is a person who has made her faith the centerpiece of her legal thinking\u2014it\u2019s a trap for Democrats to engage with any of them, right?\n\nStern: I don\u2019t really want to touch this with a 10-foot pole, but it\u2019s very obvious that Republicans are licking their chops over the prospect of any Democratic senator saying literally anything about the nominee\u2019s faith, particularly if it is Judge Barrett. And we know this because when Amy Coney Barrett was before the Senate for her hearing to go to the 7th Circuit, Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, grilled her on her faith and said, \u201cThe dogma lives loudly within you,\u201d which, I think, was inappropriate. I think was really stupid. And I think was a massive boon to Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s prospects to eventually reach the Supreme Court because there\u2019s nothing Republicans want more than to be able to play the victim card here. That is what ultimately got Brett Kavanaugh on the court. He turned around and said, I am the real victim. And they\u2019re going to run a similar playbook. This woman is a victim of bigotry, of Democratic haters, and Republicans in the Senate, you have to stand behind her.\n\nAnd let\u2019s remember Clarence Thomas. High-tech lynching. This is an old playbook, but Elie, I want to ask you the question: Is there a way of framing the question about what Judge Barrett has written about the interconnection between a judge\u2019s faith and the doctrine they produce? Is there a way to frame that question where you don\u2019t pull back a bloody stump?\n\nMystal: No matter how you do that, there will be bad faith people on the Republican side who accuse you of acting in bad faith. And no matter how you frame it, there will be cowardly chicken-livered liberals, who are like, ahhhh-gahhhh. No matter what you do, you\u2019re going to get that from both sides because the Republicans act in bad faith and the liberals act with cowardice. So it\u2019s impossible to frame it in a way that appeases both of those extreme wings, but in terms of being able to sleep with yourself at night, knowing that you have done right, of course, there is a way to ask that question. You have to ask that question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a confirmation hearing; it\u2019s a confirmation coronation. And there\u2019s no reason for the Democrats to show up for that.\u201d \u2014 Elie Mystal\n\nYou have to bring it up because she herself has brought it up. There are Catholic nominees out there who do not make their faith a particular issue in their judicial opinions. I don\u2019t begrudge her believing what she believes as a matter of faith. I begrudge her imposing it on me. That\u2019s always the issue. I have no problem with a person who says, because I am X, I believe Y in the law. Whatever problem I have with it is when you say, because I believe X, I believe Y in terms of the law, and you must as well. That\u2019s where I\u2019m like, whoa, don\u2019t tell me why Jesus doesn\u2019t want me to have an abortion. Tell me why the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution doesn\u2019t allow me to have abortion, because if you can\u2019t do that, you can\u2019t do anything for me. That\u2019s where the argument is against this issue. And of course there is a way to frame it as such, but no matter what, Republicans are going to say that you\u2019re being bigoted and Democrats are going to be scared about it.\n\nStern: Also, I just don\u2019t know how much utility there is to asking such a question, because the Federalist Society has spent 40 years now building up a kind of secular justification for many extreme rulings that might be viewed as theocratic. So there is no point in accusing someone of using their faith to judge, because there\u2019s always a neutral justification.\n\nMystal: There\u2019s no point in engaging at all. There\u2019s no point in having a hearing. There\u2019s no point in lending legitimacy to an illegitimate process by having a sit-down hearing about her issues, because it honestly doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nSo wait, stop, stop, stop. Because I absolutely was one of the people who said Democrats in the Senate shouldn\u2019t even have shown up for Neil Gorsuch\u2019s hearing, because there should be yellow crime scene tape around Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat. And it was fascinating. I covered the hearings, and I think that the Democrats in the Senate were sort of both there under protest and there fighting on the merits. I think if we really are quite serious that to engage in this hearing on the merits is to bless this hearing on the merits, is the tactic to just not show up or chain yourself to the Senate floor? In which case, you\u2019re playing right into Mike Pence\u2019s hands because Mike Pence has said, We don\u2019t need a hearing because we\u2019ve got to do this fast so she can decide the election. So this strikes me, as tactics go, as one of those very clever stunts that I agree with morally but that is going to absolutely serve the purposes of Mike Pence more than mine.\n\nMystal: Here\u2019s my play: You send one person\u2014you remember Republicans for Kavanaugh had the female assistant? You send your female assistant to the hearing room, not an actual senator because that\u2019ll make them look bad, but you send an assistant to the hearing room to engage in every possible delaying tactic on the book. You make it ugly. You make that hearing, procedurally speaking, last as long as possible, but you, the senator, add no legitimacy to the process by being there. You\u2019re busy chaining yourself to the Senate floor or holding speeches on Capitol Hill or doing whatever it is you do to \u201coppose the nominee,\u201d but you don\u2019t physically show up at the hearing to add legitimacy to it. But you also send somebody to gum up the works as much as possible. You play both sides in that fashion.\n\nLook, bottom line, if the Kavanaugh hearings didn\u2019t matter\u2014and it turned out they didn\u2019t matter\u2014then nothing matters. If what happened at the Kavanaugh hearings was not enough to make enough Republicans find a shred of conscience or decency, nothing is ever going to be enough with these current Republicans. It\u2019s not a confirmation hearing; it\u2019s a confirmation coronation. And there\u2019s no reason for the Democrats to show up for that.\n\nStern: I do think that substantive questions should be asked at this hearing by the Democratic side, and it could be one single female assistant or it could be a senator. I think that all of the substantive questions have to be about legitimacy. I don\u2019t think they should be asking this nominee about Chevron deference. We know that this nominee will overturn Chevron deference. I don\u2019t think they should even really be asking things like, how do you feel about capital punishment? We know all the dodges, we know the script, we\u2019ve been through this twice before under Trump.\n\nAnd so I think that the questions have to be really laser-focused: We know why you are here, we are now going to grill you under oath about all of the reasons why you are here and see if you\u2019re going to lie about them. Why did Donald Trump choose you? And what did he mean when he said, I need a Supreme Court justice to basically decide this election? What did he mean when he said, I need the judiciary to throw out the ballots so that I can win? Why is he pushing you through before Justice Ginsburg\u2019s funeral? Why the urgency? Why do you think you\u2019re here? And if the nominee says anything other than to hand Donald Trump the election, then we know that the nominee is a liar and that no one should trust anything this person says under oath, period.\n\nMystal: What about the current Democratic Party makes you think that they are capable of doing that?\n\nStern: Right? Well, that\u2019s the problem. The Democratic Party has been really bad at countering McConnell\u2019s moves on the judiciary throughout this entire presidency. But I think that if there is ever a moment to try to encourage this party to aspire to something like doing its job, this has got to be it. There has got to be a unified voice, a unified chorus of people saying, Democrats, you are there for a reason. This is a power grab that may destroy the court and will destroy half the entire country\u2019s faith in the court, probably forever. What are you going to do about it?\n\nTo hear the rest of their fiery conversation, listen below, or subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:26.058779", "publish_date": "2020-09-28", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-28 21:50:54.954000+00:00", "publish_time": "21:50:54", "source": "slate", "title": "Amy Coney Barrett hearings: Democrats should hammer on the illegitimacy of her SCOTUS nomination.", "topics": ["think", "scotus", "going", "illegitimacy", "dont", "democrats", "matter", "really", "republicans", "faith", "hearing", "hammer", "barrett", "coney", "nomination", "hearings", "know", "amy"]}
