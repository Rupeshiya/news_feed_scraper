It\u2019s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nHow intense are men\u2019s orgasms? My husband just told me that he\u2019s only seen stars, so to speak, a few times in his life. Most of the time, yeah, it feels nice in the genitals, but isn\u2019t earth-shaking, whole-body tremors. We have a good sex life, and he\u2019s vocal about his enjoyment (or stops making comments, which tells me what I\u2019m doing really feels good to him). Is this nice-but-not-over-the-moon orgasm a normal reaction from a certain segment of men?\n\n\u2014Fireworks\n\nDear Fireworks,\n\nThis question is about as difficult to answer as \u201cHow delicious is pizza?\u201d Responses can vary from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cbest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d depending on the maker and taster.\n\nGiven the relative ease that most men can achieve orgasm, \u201cnice\u201d is a perfectly sufficient standard in an active sex life\u2014enough nice experiences can, in fact, put someone cumulatively over the moon. That said, intensity of male orgasm can be affected by several factors. Because release is associated with pleasure here, edging\u2014or taking a long time to build up to orgasm by being brought close repeatedly before it happens\u2014can help up the \u201cwhole-body tremors\u201d when orgasm finally does take place. (\u201cShort fast buildup of sexual stimulation toward orgasm is associated with less intense orgasms than slow buildup,\u201d write the authors of a 2015 paper in the Fertility and Sterility journal). Someone who is kinky may come harder during sex in which that kink is engaged versus a vanilla session. Some men report earth-shaking responses to prostate orgasms (and indeed, examples of them are readily streamable online). The physiological reason for such a marked difference in quality is, as the aforementioned paper reports, that prostatic massage orgasms are associated with 12 pelvic muscle contractions, versus penile orgasms\u2019 four to eight. (So-called P-spot orgasms are generally achieved via specialized toys, and even then, there\u2019s a learning curve and required patience that make them difficult for many men to execute.) There\u2019s also some evidence that Kegels or pelvic floor exercises can help strengthen men\u2019s orgasms, much as they can women\u2019s. For optimal functioning, I think everyone for whom it is not unhealthy should be doing (but not overdoing) Kegels.\n\nFrom my male point of view, it does seem like very orgasmic women tend to feel the wave harder, but there are plenty of guys who do see stars from something as common as a blow job. And just like there are women who never orgasm, so there are men who don\u2019t, or whose orgasms are way less intense than they\u2019d like. There\u2019s a huge range, which makes answering this question particularly difficult. If your husband isn\u2019t complaining about his orgasms\u2014and many men aren\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s probably no issue.\n\nGet the How to Do It Newsletter Sex advice from Rich and Stoya, plus follow-ups, delivered weekly.

About a year ago, she and I decided to try to do the FWB thing, and it was really great. We grew even closer as friends, had great adventurous sex all the time, and our daily text communications became peppered with sexting and horny image-sharing. This continued until she got sick a month or two ago and wasn\u2019t healthy enough for sex. We consensually saved some of the nudes we\u2019d send each other and would sometimes send them back to each other when we were feeling flirty (i.e., \u201cLook how hot you are here. I want to be seeing you in person like this right now,\u201d etc.). In the past, every time I\u2019ve broken off a relationship with someone who sent nudes, I\u2019ve always chosen to delete their images because I personally don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ethical to \u201choard nudes.\u201d But I don\u2019t know if I can, or should, bring myself to delete these ones. They\u2019ve become more than just snapshots of a former tryst; they are memories of my best friend, keepsakes of a time during which this was my dearest person. I\u2019m deep in grief, processing the loss and trying to figure out what my future without this beloved person looks like. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s right or ethical for me to save these photos. But deleting them feels like erasing part of the beautiful person who means more to me than anyone else. What should I do?\n\n\u2014Archive\n\nDear Archive,\n\nI\u2019m so sorry that you lost your best friend. You ask what\u2019s \u201cright or ethical.\u201d I think your conscience has a parachute because your friend consented to you saving her images. Unless she expressly asked you to delete them after the fact, she died assuming that you hadn\u2019t. Your conflict results from within: Though you are not explicitly obligated to do so, you have taken it upon yourself to delete the images of past lovers once your time together has ended. Given the extraordinary circumstances, including the untimely death of your friend, an extraordinary response is understandable. I think it is OK to hold onto these tangible memories to help you grieve and honor someone who meant a lot to you.\n\nThe only practical reason I see not to hold onto the pictures is the possibility of a security breach in the event of theft or some compromise of your cloud; to protect against this, save them on a protected hard drive that you aren\u2019t backing up virtually.\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI recently had someone over for some fun times (I know, I know, but my area has handled COVID pretty well, hookups don\u2019t happen often, and we had a safety discussion beforehand). In the middle of it, he asked if he could film. I asked who it was for, and he said just him and his partner, and I agreed under those conditions and as long as my face wasn\u2019t showing. Welp, two weeks later, I run through my Snapchat stories and recognize the upholstery in one of his uploads. I then discovered he also uploaded it to Pornhub. My face isn\u2019t showing, but it was definitely my lower body.\n\nI\u2019m furious and really kind of freaked out. I reported the Snap and the upload, and cussed him out over it. The problem is, he\u2019s gaslighting me, saying that I had given permission as long as my face wasn\u2019t showing, what\u2019s the harm, etc. He clearly doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s done anything wrong, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any other recourse available for me. Is there anything else I should be watching out for?\n\n\u2014Exposed\n\nDear Exposed,\n\nThis is an incredibly shitty thing to have to go through, and I feel for you. Fortunately, recourse is potentially available, though it will depend where you are. U.S. revenge porn laws vary by state, said Norma Buster, the client relations manager at C.A. Goldberg, a New York law firm whose namesake attorney, Carrie Goldberg, is among the best known revenge-porn lawyers in the country. Buster is not a lawyer herself, but she meets with potential clients and has spoken with what she says are hundreds of people who have reported being victims of these types of crimes. She came into this line of work as a result of an ex posting nude content of her on Pornhub.\n\nBuster first wanted to address the gaslighting: \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d she told me by phone. \u201cConsenting to taking a video does not mean that you consented for it to be up on the internet. I know what you consented to and what you didn\u2019t. People often try to shame others. I\u2019ve had people say to me, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sure you learned not to send photos after that.\u2019 That\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\nBuster said that if you\u2019re going to pursue a lawsuit, it\u2019s important for you to screenshot everything: messages to and from this guy, the video (record it if you can), the URL\u2014everything involved. The C.A. Goldberg site offers resources on revenge porn laws by state, as well as how to report offending videos to the platforms that host them. I\u2019m not sure if you succeeded in getting the video removed from Pornhub\u2014Buster said that her content was removed in 27 minutes when she reported it, and this was five years ago. But she has heard stories where the removal didn\u2019t go nearly as smoothly.\n\nEven if the stuff is already taken down, you may be able to file a lawsuit against this person for violating the law. In her case, Buster said she literally had to print out the law when she went to the precinct because the police had no idea how to respond to such an offense. It will probably be useful to know your exact rights. Depending on your state, you could also pursue a civil suit, but keep in mind that may cost you more than it yields, as its outcome will be contingent on the financial situation of the defendant (and, of course, the ability to secure a verdict in your favor). You should keep in mind that pursuing legal action can be draining not just financially but emotionally, and if you want to avoid the legal system all together, you could look into a restorative justice process. Good luck.\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI\u2019m a heterosexual man in my 30s and I\u2019ve been into curvy, chubby, and full-bodied girls my entire life. I\u2019m currently in a long-term seven-year relationship with a lovely, brilliant, wonderful, and caring woman who\u2019s a few years older than I am. I feel our emotional connection is really deep and our bond is quite strong.\n\nThere is, however, something missing in our sex life. We normally have sex one to two times a week and it is OK, but I feel like I really want way more than that, probably four to five times a week. Moreover, I\u2019m into dirty talk\u2014really, really descriptive dirty talk\u2014and a bit of aggressiveness, spanking, hair-pulling, etc., but she\u2019s not into that (at least not nearly as much as I am). We\u2019ve spoken about these two aspects in the past, and while she did start being a bit more vocal, I feel like she\u2019s forcing herself to do it just because she knows I like it, and that ends up being a major turn-off for me. Plus, right after the two times we\u2019ve spoken about it, she started trying to increase the frequency, but I found it quite awkward: We would go to bed and scroll on Instagram for half an hour, and only once I put it down and kiss her good night, then she dropped her phone and started rushing into touching and kissing me. It felt so much like an afterthought, like she was only trying not to forget something I wanted to do\u2014rather than doing it because she felt like she wanted to\u2014that I just told her a few times that it felt too forced and that I didn\u2019t want to (not because I was mad, but because that itself was a HUGE turn-off for me as well).\n\nI have cheated on her about four to five times with two different women, and I do not feel good at all after doing it. I have thought a lot about an open relationship (which I\u2019m not entirely happy with), but after being with her for seven years, I\u2019m almost certain she will not accept that as an option. I almost feel like my two only options are ending a loving, meaningful, and quite honestly beautiful relationship or enduring sexual dissatisfaction for the rest of my life. One option makes me feel like a superficial piece of shit for dropping a really positive relationship of seven years and a person I genuinely love, and the other one makes me feel bad with myself for knowingly remaining in a relationship that doesn\u2019t fulfill my sex life or forcing her to be accommodating to my desires even when she doesn\u2019t enjoy it. Internally, I feel like there\u2019s no good choice (we spoke twice and nothing has fundamentally changed) and that every choice I can make is wrong. And I really, really do not feel it is OK to cheat on her and do not consider it a long-term option. What do I do?\n\n\u2014Just Not That Into It\n\nDear JNTII,\n\nIf you are, in fact, incompatible, then you have indeed outlined your options. What I\u2019m left wondering, though, is what your partner is into. Do you know? Have you inquired? I know that you may have, and that the answer might not be much, but I\u2019d give her the opportunity\u2014one you\u2019ve already taken\u2014to state what kind of sex would be satisfying for her, and to name whatever interests of hers that you just aren\u2019t exploring. When many people write in, they naturally center themselves, but in some instances I wonder if this has more to do with their general approach to life and relationships than just advice-column conciseness. This is one of those instances.\n\nI know exactly what you mean about wanting a partner to want the sex that they have with you, and how that can accelerate your libido\u2019s already spinning wheels. But surely, your partner deserves an A for effort here, after agreeing to partake in behavior for your sake that you know she wouldn\u2019t be inclined to do on her own. She seems like a generous, loving partner who cares about your satisfaction and well-being. Can you say you\u2019ve been the same to her? The evidence provided\u2014including cheating behind her back her repeatedly\u2014suggests you cannot. (I\u2019m also not sure why you mention that you\u2019ve been into \u201ccurvy, chubby, and full-bodied girls\u201d your whole life\u2014do you think they\u2019re lucky to have you?)\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful when the sexual connection comes just as easily as an emotional one, but it\u2019s rare that a long-term relationship sustains effortlessly. It doesn\u2019t typically just work out by itself; it requires the participants\u2019 work. Figure out how much you\u2019re putting in, what you can improve, and whether you\u2019re willing to do so. You might still find that you\u2019re sexually incompatible, that you\u2019re left with exactly the same hard options, but it would be a real shame to one day look back on ending a relationship with someone you genuinely love, knowing that you could have done more but didn\u2019t.\n\n\u2014Rich\n\nMore How to Do It\n\nI have been married for 15 months, but I have known my husband for almost 20 years. Last January, something just wasn\u2019t right. I am a nurse and just happened to work a rare night shift. I looked at the GPS app around 5 a.m. to see if my husband was at the casino; he had been spending lots of time there. To my shock, I saw him driving very slowly in a sketchy part of town. This went on for hours. When I got home at 8 a.m., he acted as if he had never been anywhere. He then took a long nap, and I was able to get into his iPad and iPhone. What I found was very disturbing.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:28.574020", "publish_date": "2020-09-29", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-29 20:54:07.531000+00:00", "publish_time": "20:54:07", "source": "slate", "title": "How men experience orgasm: Do all guys climax like my husband?", "topics": ["orgasm", "know", "times", "life", "im", "climax", "husband", "relationship", "guys", "sex", "feel", "men", "really", "experience", "orgasms"]}
