{"authors": ["Daniel Brook"], "body": "In the Aesop\u2019s Fables version of the stock market, there are bulls and there are bears. Bulls think the market will go up, so they buy stocks. Bears think the market will fall, so they sell them.\n\nIn the actual real-life stock market, bears don\u2019t just sit out a potential market crash; they try to profit from it by shorting stocks. A bear can borrow shares from a broker and agree to sell them back at the same price at a future date. After borrowing the shares, the bear sells them for cash only to buy back the same number of shares right before returning them. If the stock goes down in the interim, the bear pockets the difference.\n\nComplex as it sounds, placing a bet that a stock will fall takes no more keystrokes or phone-swipes than buying a stock on the hunch it\u2019ll go up\u2014but only if you\u2019re richer than the average bear. Hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals short stocks all the time. But when it comes to ordinary investors like me, the financial services industry greets an interest in shorting stocks as a request for a revolver with one bullet in the chamber. Should it?\n\nHere\u2019s why I want to short the market: The disconnect between Wall Street and the real economy has rarely been wider. Right now, the Dow is hovering near all-time highs but our economy is still dragging from a pandemic whose duration is anyone\u2019s guess. Marketplace\u2019s Kai Ryssdal recently prefaced his daily stock market update with the wisecrack \u201cRemind me if you\u2019ve heard this one before.\u201d Yet again, Ryssdal explained, the market had shrugged off wretched economic news and gone up on reports from some tiny, preliminary coronavirus vaccine study. It\u2019s no surprise that the phrase irrational exuberance, coined during the late 1990s tech stock bubble, has come back into vogue.\n\nFiguring that the stock market couldn\u2019t stay frozen like Wile E. Coyote over the abyss of economic reality forever, I decided to place the simplest bet possible that stocks would go down: shorting the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The simplicity is what appealed to me. I\u2019m no day trader\u2014even under quarantine conditions that have made it more popular than ever\u2014nor do I closely track the stock market. But as a newshound, I ambiently pick up major moves in the market without really trying. When the market moves so dramatically that it pushes the other news off the front page, I know I\u2019ll see it and could then consider unwinding my bet\u2014even though, as I soon learned, my brokerage doesn\u2019t trust me to do it.\n\nI have a 401(k) with Fidelity, opened years ago as a benefit of a job at a now-defunct alt-weekly newspaper. I checked to see if I could short the Dow through it. The simplest choice was investing in ProShares Short Dow30, a fund that shorts the stocks in the Dow in order to approximate the inverse movement of the market each day. If the Dow falls 2 percent, the fund rises 2 percent. (The fund\u2019s ticker symbol is DOG; apparently BEAR was not an option.) Other funds take a more aggressive approach to the same goal, using leverage to magnify market movements. Rydex Inverse Dow 2x Strategy Fund (RYCWX), for example, aims to double the daily movement of the Dow in the opposite direction.\n\nBut actually buying shares of DOG isn\u2019t as simple as purchasing shares of a fund that moves in tandem with the Dow, such as SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). When I tried to place the trade through Fidelity\u2019s website, I got a slew of buyer-beware warnings. Most just required acknowledging that I\u2019d read some intimidating legalese, but the final one required action on my part to make the trade go through. Only if I first changed my stated investment strategy to \u201cmost aggressive\u201d\u2014the highest risk-tolerance level in Fidelity\u2019s eight strategy categories and the one with the longest time horizon and the fewest guardrails\u2014could I make the trade.\n\nA glance at the past century of the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that, yes, it has gone up over the long term, but there have been multidecade troughs.\n\nThe whole thing struck me as bizarre. After all, I was placing this trade to be more conservative. I was worried\u2014I think justifiably\u2014that the market would take a significant fall, and I wanted to protect myself from it. I was moving about a fifth of my account from a variety of bullish investment funds to the most general of bear funds. But to do so I had to label myself \u201cmost aggressive.\u201d Meanwhile, if I blithely bet that the stock market would keep rising despite the pandemic and mass unemployment, Fidelity would see that as somehow less aggressive.\n\nI called Fidelity\u2019s media relations department to find out why they made it so hard to bet against the market. Eventually, I received a one-sentence email in my inbox from Robert Beauregard, the company\u2019s director of external communications, with the subject heading \u201cShorting to DOW.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d Beauregard wrote, \u201cbut Fidelity is unable to assist you with your request at this time.\u201d Receiving a no-comment from the top of the corporate pyramid of one of America\u2019s leading 401(k) administrators, a firm with literally trillions in assets under management, only made me more curious. I decided to call in to the normal trading line and ask a trader why Fidelity made it so hard to short the Dow as an ordinary customer. After all, I was one.\n\nMy call to Fidelity\u2019s 1-800 number routed me to a trader I\u2019ll call Byers B. Ware, who was willing to explain what Robert Beauregard in corporate would not. \u201cAny time [a customer is] betting against the markets,\u201d Ware told me, they\u2019re brushing up against what he called Fidelity\u2019s official \u201coutlook\u201d: \u201cFidelity as a company, our outlook is it\u2019s always going to go up, so anytime you\u2019re inversing that in any way, [red flags are] going to pop up.\u201d I gave him my arguments about why, in the short to medium term, I thought the market was more likely to go down\u2014the worst pandemic in a century, elevated unemployment filings now plateauing at nearly 1 million a week. Before I could even get to what I planned to delicately dub \u201cthe national leadership vacuum,\u201d Ware conceded, \u201cI get it, myself, as an investor.\u201d I asked Ware if there were any events or economic conditions that would ever push Fidelity to ever have a negative outlook\u2014clearly the pandemic didn\u2019t cut it, but now I was thinking along the lines of things like nuclear wars. \u201cI would say no,\u201d he responded tersely.\n\nIt\u2019s true that over the very long term, Fidelity has been right: The Dow has proved to be a good investment. After dipping when the world went into economic lockdown this spring, the index rebounded to hit record highs this year\u2014and any asset at record highs, by definition, has gone up over the long term. But as John Maynard Keynes famously quipped, \u201cin the long run we are all dead.\u201d And a company that specializes in 401(k)s for middle-class investors ought to have the outlook that in the long run our customers are all retired. Indeed, the tax benefits of 401(k)s are contingent upon account holders drawing them down after turning age 72 at the very latest. A glance at the past century of the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that, yes, it has gone up over the long term, but there have been multidecade troughs\u2014troughs during which millions of people retired and relied on savings they\u2019d invested in the stock market. After the 1929 crash, the Dow did not recover to its pre-crash levels until 1959. It hit a new high in 1966, only to fall back down and not fully recover until 1995. Defending Fidelity\u2019s perma-bull outlook, Ware told me, \u201cIf we look at it historically, it\u2019s always going up.\u201d To which the bear replies with an emphatic \u201cYes, but.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Fidelity that looks askance if you want to short the Dow. The popular day trading app Robinhood takes a more hands-off approach, lettings its users buy inverse index funds without any inverse-specific warnings but restricting which of its customers can make more complex inverse trades. At Charles Schwab, potential DOG buyers must disregard a stern online warning complete with a triangular yellow hazard road sign icon warning, \u201cNot suitable for most investors.\u201d I was bemused to find that Schwab\u2019s listing for Luckin Coffee\u2014a Chinese coffee chain stock that has lost nearly all of its value after an accounting fraud scandal and is being sued by its investors in a class-action lawsuit\u2014comes with no such caveat emptor.\n\nSchwab spokesperson Erin Montgomery offered that the company is committed to an \u201copen architecture approach\u201d in its trading platform that lets customers buy \u201calmost any exchange-traded product within their Schwab accounts\u201d but also \u201ceducat[es] our clients about [their] investment products[\u2019] associated risks.\u201d This includes a blanket warning on all inverse funds, since they reset daily in a manner somewhat akin to compound interest. In Schwab\u2019s educational hypothetical, over the course of a year when the market goes up nearly 2 percent, a simple inverse fund could lose nearly 5 percent. In real life, over the course of 2019, the Dow rocketed 23 percent while DOG fell 13 percent. If an investor kept DOG over the long bull market since the Great Recession, they would have lost most of their investment. But inverse index funds are not meant to be buy-and-hold investments; they\u2019re short- to medium-term bets on the general direction of the market.\n\nFinancial planners recommend against these funds with varying levels of vehemence. Every certified financial planner I contacted through the national Financial Planning Association warned against putting retirement money in inverse index funds. Michael McKevitt of Palatine, Illinois, acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s tempting for people to think they will get ahead if they can miss out on the next 20 percent decline, but those who try it rarely do it successfully.\u201d H. Jude Boudreaux of New Orleans elaborated: \u201cLet\u2019s say that you do happen to guess right, and things start to go down. When do you sell? How do you know it\u2019s time to get out and buy back in to a long portfolio? You\u2019re not just creating one choice\u2014you\u2019re creating two choices.\u201d George Gagliardi, of Lexington, Massachusetts, suggested that sitting out a potential bear market is safer than betting on one: \u201cIf you\u2019re nervous about the market, stick to nonvolatile assets like cash and short-term Treasury notes.\u201d\n\nIt should be said that certain trades, such as shorting an individual stock, really can be dangerous. While the worst-case scenario when buying a stock is that it goes to zero and you lose your entire investment, there is, in theory, no limit on how high a stock can go and thus no limit to how much money one can lose on an ill-advised short. You can see why financial planners wouldn\u2019t want their clients to go anywhere near this with their retirement accounts.\n\nIndeed, with the global economy in uncharted territory, some market novices have gotten themselves into serious trouble placing sophisticated bets. Ordinary day traders got burned holding oil futures this year when a global glut briefly sent the price of oil into negative territory. Investors who had already lost everything they\u2019d put in were then asked to cough up even more cash.\n\nBut shorting a major stock market index like the Dow or the S&P 500 is far lower-risk than shorting an individual stock or speculating in commodities futures. The real problem is that it\u2019s ideological heresy. Being a pessimist in an economy built on optimism has always been stigmatized. The first bans on short selling go all the way back to 17th century Amsterdam at the dawn of finance capitalism. More recently, mainland China opened its first stock exchanges with short selling forbidden and even now imposes temporary restrictions on shorting whenever the market falls precipitously, most recently with the pandemic. It is the softer contemporary equivalent of the bad old days in the East Bloc when naysayers who thought the future of the communist economy might not be as glorious as the Party promised risked being condemned to mental institutions as clinically insane.\n\nOf course, your brokerage house can\u2019t lock you up if you think the market will go down. It won\u2019t stop you from putting your money where your mouth is. It\u2019ll just tell you in a lot of legalese that it thinks you\u2019re crazy. Some might even tell you straight up. Dennis Nolte, a financial planner in Oviedo, Florida, emailed me that that anyone considering shorting the Dow should be referred to \u201ca good therapist.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe they\u2019re right. Thus far, at least, my bet against the market hasn\u2019t paid off. In the context of my overall 401(k), having a portion in inverse index funds has just smoothed out market swings, making my portfolio more conservative, not more lucrative. Call me a heretic, but I\u2019m sticking with my bear fund until the next correction. I still think the perma-bulls are full of it.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:33.349683", "publish_date": "2020-09-18", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-18 18:47:46.250000+00:00", "publish_time": "18:47:46", "source": "slate", "title": "What Happened When I Tried to Short the Dow", "topics": ["short", "tried", "funds", "dow", "shorting", "fidelity", "market", "happened", "bear", "inverse", "stock", "long"]}
