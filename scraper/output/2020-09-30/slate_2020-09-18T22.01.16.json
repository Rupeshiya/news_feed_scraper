{"authors": ["Jordan Weissmann"], "body": "For most of his congressional career, Chuck Schumer has been known for his relentlessly moderate political instincts, keyed to the imagined sensibilities of middle-class suburban New Yorkers. This is a man famous for thinking through policy issues by asking how they\u2019d play with \u201cthe Baileys,\u201d a fictional married couple from Massapequa, Long Island, who, as Schumer has explained, hate property taxes and love singing along to the national anthem before a hockey game. From his days helping to write the 1994 crime bill to voting for the Iraq war to defending tax loopholes for Wall Street to backing a border fence to opposing President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran deal, the Senate minority leader staked out years of centrist and business-friendly positions that have led to deep distrust among progressive activists (even if he\u2019s later reversed on them).\n\nBut lately, something\u2019s been different about Schumer: He\u2019s been moving to the left, and Washington has started to notice. A few weeks back, for instance, Politico published a piece headlined \u201cChuck Schumer isn\u2019t an \u2018angry centrist\u2019 anymore,\u201c which declared that after decades on Capitol Hill, his \u201cpolitical evolution may be nearly complete.\u201d Oddly, the piece did not actually mention any of the progressive policy proposals that Schumer has thrown his weight behind recently. But there have been several notable ones.\n\nIn July, Schumer joined Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden to unveil a bill that would tie the size of unemployment benefits to the jobless rate, turning them into a so-called automatic stabilizer\u2014an idea that House Speaker Nancy Speaker had previously ruled out as too costly.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Schumer and Massachusetts\u2019 Ed Markey\u2014the left\u2019s new favorite septuagenarian \u2014unveiled a climate- and social justice\u2013focused economic agenda that called for zeroing out carbon emissions from electricity by 2035, and was backed by a long roll call of left-wing activist groups, including the Green New Dealers of the Sunrise Movement.\n\nEarlier this week, Schumer told the cannabis industry website Leafly that he was \u201cfervently committed\u201d to finally decriminalizing and unscheduling marijuana, after introducing a bill to do so last year. \u201cThe states have been the labs of democracy and we\u2019ve had our lab experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey proved that legalization is the right thing to do. So let\u2019s do it for the whole country. \u201d\n\nIn perhaps the most surprising turn, Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a resolution on Thursday urging the next president (meaning Biden) to forgive up to $50,000 of outstanding debt for student loan borrowers purely using executive authority. Warren floated this idea during her presidential run, and by definition it wouldn\u2019t require legislation, but Schumer\u2019s endorsement was a valuable boost from Democratic leadership. It\u2019s also the second time the two have linked arms on the issue: In March, they introduced a proposal to pay down at least $10,000 of student debt for each borrower during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nFinally, and tantalizingly, Schumer has left open the possibility that he would try to abolish the filibuster in order to push through Democratic priorities. As he\u2019s told Politico, \u201cnothing is off the table.\u201d\n\nIn short, Schumer is cuing up a Democratic agenda that entails climate justice, legal weed, mass student debt cancellation, a better safety net, and possibly the end of stodgy, bill-killing Senate procedure as we know it. Twitter has begun to joke that the Baileys must have been radicalized. But what triggered them? Did their kid rack up a six-figure student loan bill at NYU?\n\nIn some ways, it looks like Schumer is really just setting the table for the bolder, more progressive planks of Joe Biden\u2019s presidential platform. The climate resolution he introduced with Markey, for instance, is very much a congressional counterpart to Biden\u2019s own, Green New Deal\u2013influenced environmental agenda.\n\nBut in other cases, Schumer does seem to be nudging the party\u2019s nominee in a bolder direction. Take student debt: After Schumer and Warren introduced their March plan to pay off at least $10,000 for each borrower, Biden backed it. Then, Biden went further, saying he would forgive all student loans for Americans earning less than $125,000, as long as they borrowed to pay undergrad tuition at a public college. With this newest proposal, Schumer and Warren are now shepherding Biden even further in the direction of a broad jubilee.\n\nThen there\u2019s weed. Biden has stubbornly said he only supports \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d marijuana. The minority leader\u2019s bill would finally let states have fully aboveboard recreational markets.1 Just call him Chuck Choomer.\n\nOne common theory among the online left is that Schumer is trying to guard against a potential primary challenge in 2022, after watching progressives pick off two older, white, centrist members of the New York Democratic establishment. In 2018 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, who was the House\u2019s fourth-ranking Democrat, and this year Jamaal Bowman unseated Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel. Schumer himself is very, very unlikely to ever actually lose his seat\u2014New York tends to elect moderate Democrats like Gov. Andrew Cuomo to statewide office thanks to the influence of suburban voters and unions\u2014but it\u2019s possible he\u2019s trying to prevent a messy race that would require him to spend money and effort campaigning.\n\nThere might be some truth to that theory (after all, even Cuomo took steps to shore up his progressive flank before his last reelection race). But the simpler explanation is that Schumer simply sees his party\u2019s ideological center moving and is shifting with it, as he has tended to do in the past. In this sense, he\u2019s not that different from Biden, another career-long centrist who has always been more a political than ideological animal, and is now running on the most progressive platform of any modern major party nominee. \u201cA good elected official looks at the needs of the people he or she represents and does everything he or she can to help solve those needs, and the world changes,\u201d Schumer told Politico.\n\nAnd the polling on issues changes, too. After all, two-thirds of Americans now back full marijuana legalization, and there\u2019s no particular political advantage to pursuing a half-measure. After four years of the Trump administration, there\u2019s a strong chance the Baileys would like to finally light up a joint and relax.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:33.238503", "publish_date": "2020-09-18", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-18 22:01:16.750000+00:00", "publish_time": "22:01:16", "source": "slate", "title": "Chuck Schumer is a lefty now.", "topics": ["schumer", "chuck", "political", "democratic", "progressive", "student", "biden", "debt", "bill", "hes", "lefty", "warren"]}
