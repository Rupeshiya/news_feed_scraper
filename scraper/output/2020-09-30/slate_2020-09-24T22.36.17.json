{"authors": ["Willa Paskin"], "body": "If the third time\u2019s the charm, what happens when the third time arrives and you remain uncharmed? When the \u201ctime\u201d in question is the third season of FX\u2019s critical darling Fargo, and the uncharmed \u201cyou\u201d is me, a grouchy TV critic, the answer is: wait a while and try for the fourth. After a hiatus of three years, Noah Hawley\u2019s anthology series returns this week and tries to meet the times\u2014but there\u2019s a reason saying fourth time\u2019s a charm isn\u2019t a thing.\n\nSix long years ago, the first season of Fargo premiered, chronicling absurd and snowballing ultra-violence in the snowy climes of the upper Midwest, where galoots and bone-chilling criminals did dark deeds no one who saw them would ever forget. The heart of the show, like that of the Coen brothers movie that inspired it, was a decent female police officer wonderfully played by Allison Tolman, riffing on Frances McDormand\u2019s indelible Marge Gunderson. But the finale pushes her to the side, because like so many of the prestige dramas that came before it (although fewer that have come after), Fargo was primarily concerned with the live-wire connection between men and violence.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

Even episodes that don\u2019t feature it promise some to come, with title cards that read: \u201cAt the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.\u201d The jocular, knowing promise of those lines (borrowed wholesale from the Coens) is what distinguishes Fargo. Yes, it\u2019s another show that moodily explores the connection between manhood and violence and the depredations within the human soul, but it\u2019s the one that does so with zany comedic deadpan\u2014and accents, jokes, fleet camera work, obsessive period settings, kookily detailed plots, weird characters, and a woman or two in a high-profile role. For people who are into this sort of thing, Fargo is like a deconstructed pizza: It\u2019s the thing you like, but more adventurous\u2014the pepperoni is cut in the shape of Minnesota, or a meat cleaver, and you can sprinkle it on yourself. But it\u2019s not a great time for pepperoni, when pepperoni\u2014as in this now overkneaded metaphor\u2014is violent white guy angst.\n\nFargo is tied up in the prestige tropes of six years ago, when the plight of menacing and tortured white men was widely accepted shorthand for seriousness of purpose and quality (although even then, those tropes were nearly exhausted). The fourth season, delayed from April to September because of COVID-19, is aware that the series\u2019 prior preoccupations alone will no longer cut it. The new season explicitly concerns race and takes as its central characters not only violent white men, but Black ones as well. But in trying to say something about the essential criminality of America, a country built on exploiting Black people, it is more clunkily and explicitly thematic than earlier seasons, and almost doubly fixated on generational machismo, such that its female characters never quite come off the sidelines.\n\nThis is the case even though the show begins with a self-possessed young, Black, female high school student, Ethelrida Pearl Smutney (E\u2019myri Crutchfield) being beaten by her principal, as she narrates her history report: \u201cFrederick Douglass once intoned, \u2018I stand before you as a thief and a robber \u2026 the moment our feet touched American soil we were already criminals.\u2019 \u201d Despite it remaining unclear (at least through the first nine episodes) how or why Ethelrida would have so much interest in or knowledge about the Kansas City underworld, that is what the rest of her history report contains, the contents of which she shares with the audience. First, she explains, there were the Jews, who were ousted by the Irish, who were ousted by the Italians. In an attempt to keep the peace, a custom was developed. The ruling families would trade sons, theoretically keeping them from violence, lest that son die in retaliation. Even though this ritual has never had the hoped-for result, in 1950, they are still at it, and this time the groups trading offspring are the Italian Faddas and the city\u2019s new criminal outfit, which, unlike the prior criminal outfits, is not made up of immigrants. They have come north in the great migration. The Black gang is led by Loy Cannon (Chris Rock), who seems much more aboveboard than his mafia counterparts, and is even trying to get his plan for a newfangled \u201ccredit card\u201d off the ground with white bankers. (Guess how that goes.) The moment the mafia boss and Loy trade offspring should inaugurate a momentary peace. Needless to say, it does not.\n\nThe Fadda capo almost immediately dies (in a kind of quotation from The Wire)and is replaced by his son Josto (Jason Schwartzman), who is soon dealing with an expansion attempt by Loy. His brother Gaetano (Salvatore Esposito) has also recently arrived from the old country. A former Mussolini Blackshirt \u2014to make another intra-TV connection, he is essentially kin to the menacing, black market figures who haunted Len\u00f9\u2019s Neapolitan childhood in My Brilliant Friend\u2014he is also a complete and total psycho. Esposito plays him with big acting choices you don\u2019t often see on TV: He laughs, he sobs, he whispers, and his eyes bug out of his head. He is intermittently terrifying and ridiculous, but either way, he\u2019s running very hot, which stands out in a show that loves the cool touch.\n\nSoon, there\u2019s a mob war on, and Fargo is on more well-trod territory than it\u2019s ever been before, not just cribbing from the Coens\u2019 Miller\u2019s Crossing, but The Godfather to boot. It does have all sorts of characters that you don\u2019t usually see in a turf war, but they get inconsistent screen time. There\u2019s Ethelrida, the biracial daughter of mortuary owners in debt, who seems like she\u2019s going to be the good woman who is so often the show\u2019s moral center, but she can\u2019t get a solid storyline. She lives across the street from kooky and outspoken nurse Oraetta Mayflower (Jessie Buckley), whose Minnesota accent belies a murderous streak and a willingness to spike apple pie with ipecac\u2014a gag that, like Chekhov\u2019s gun, goes off in the middle of a heist, conducted by two lady outlaws with the swaggering names of Zelmare Roulette (Karen Aldridge) and Swanee Capps (Kelsey Asbille), and who are\u2014credit where it\u2019s due\u2014pretty fun.*\n\nMore central to the mob plot is Rabbi Milligan (Ben Whishaw), an Irish son raised by Jewish gangsters and now allied with the Italians, who sets himself the task of protecting Loy\u2019s son. (Their story climaxes in the black-and-white ninth episode, which I mention just to say: Yes, this is a show with a very special black-and-white episode about the relationship between someone who is Black and someone who is white. Anyway.) There\u2019s also Odis Weff (Jack Huston), a dirty cop with OCD and PTSD who finds himself having to help an extremely clean-cut, carrot stick\u2013chomping, Mormon U.S. marshal played by Timothy Olyphant. If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is\u2014but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage.\n\nThe white ethnic groups that run Kansas City are on their way up the ladder, but the Black families, who have been American much longer, will never stop being Black. The show sometimes explores this with relative subtlety, as in the first episode, when the Italians are turned away from an upscale private hospital by a WASP administrator just as Loy Cannon is brushed off by a white banker, or even in the casting of Schwartzman, who with his perpetual adolescent sneer and hilariously obnoxious line readings always emanates coddling. But more often the show delves into these themes with topic sentences like \u201cTo be American is to pretend\u201d and \u201cAmericans love a crime story. We are a crime story!\u201d At one point Josto gives an anachronistically self-aware speech explicitly stating that ethnic white groups\u2019 nonwhiteness is, unlike the Black group\u2019s, only temporary. \u201cWe root for the taker. America loves a man who takes what he wants, unless he looks like you,\u201d Josto tells Loy. \u201cI can take all the money and the pussy I want and I can still run for president. But for you, it\u2019s always gonna be the rope.\u201d Loy is given to saying things like \u201cI\u2019m fighting 400 years of history. I\u2019m fighting a mindset.\u201d\n\nIf this makes the show sound kind of campy, that\u2019s not quite it. This is a highly professional endeavor, and there\u2019s nothing (too) embarrassing happening here. The show\u2019s self-seriousness leans toward the dull more than the ridiculous, although some ridiculousness would be more fun. It doesn\u2019t help that Rock, who has described this as the best part he\u2019s \u201cever, ever, ever\u201d had, is in such single-mindedly dramatic mode that he does not bring any looseness or lightness to his role, even when he\u2019s sniffing dollar bills with a telltale whiff of puke. He, like the season more generally, seems dedicated to making something relevant, a noble impulse that sometimes weighs down this bizarre and gruesome period fiction, a show that wants to speak to the times more than it actually does.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:34.516323", "publish_date": "2020-09-24", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-24 22:36:17.956000+00:00", "publish_time": "22:36:17", "source": "slate", "title": "Review: Fargo Season 4 thinks it has something to say about race in America.", "topics": ["times", "fargo", "season", "thinks", "loy", "theres", "does", "white", "son", "race", "america", "review", "say", "black", "groups"]}
