{"authors": [], "body": "This week, we\u2019re all pundits as we discuss the first presidential debate and the state of the U.S. election. What did you make of it? What do you think people in Florida and Wisconsin made of it? What did your racist uncle (you know the one) make of it? What are any of us to make of an election that has become a referendum on facism?\n\nThe Open Discussions are here for commenters to connect with one another outside the fast-moving, sometimes contentious article pages. It\u2019s a place for online friends to share a joke or newcomers to get their feet wet. As always, our discussion topic is a suggestion, not a command, so feel free to (civilly) talk among yourselves.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:28.872361", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 09:58:01.593000+00:00", "publish_time": "09:58:01", "source": "slate", "title": "Open Discussion: The first presidential debate.", "topics": ["wisconsin", "presidential", "uncle", "topic", "wet", "talk", "suggestion", "state", "discussion", "think", "week", "debate", "election", "open"]}
