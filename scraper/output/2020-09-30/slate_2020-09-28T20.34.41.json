{"authors": ["Rumaan Alam"], "body": "On this week\u2019s episode of Working, Rumaan Alam spoke with Charles Finch. Finch is the author of the bestselling Charles Lenox mystery novels and the literary novel The Last Enchantments; he is also a prolific book critic. They discussed the purpose of literary criticism, the structural issues it presents, and the sheer joy of the job. This partial transcript of their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nRumaan Alam: To be a critic is not just to discharge your own enthusiasm for reading. It\u2019s to do some other thing. What is that other thing?\n\nCharles Finch: For me, books evoke a feeling first, and then you have to try to feel lucidly in words. When I read Ali Smith\u2019s most recent book, it stirred up all these interesting and strange feelings in me. Then, as a critic, I had to go back and look at where I put an exclamation point in the margin, and I have to try to cobble together something lucid and intelligent and rational about that. That\u2019s the art of criticism to me: trying to explain emotions, which, in a way, all art forms are trying to do through different means.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing sounds to me like a matter of personal reckoning. You, Charlie Finch, had a single experience reading Ali Smith\u2019s novel Summer. You were tasked with responding to that feeling, or distilling it, in 2,000 words. What is the value to the reader or to the culture more broadly of that 2,000-word essay?\n\nThere are a lot of reviews that don\u2019t have a lot of value, if it\u2019s just a recapitulation of plot or if it\u2019s just a statement of preference. The best reviews often have an essayistic quality. They\u2019re trying to say, what is this telling us about our moment of life? What is this saying in the context of the author\u2019s other work? I don\u2019t agree completely that it\u2019s about personal reckoning or personal preference. With every book I review of every genre, I try to go to the writer\u2019s 5-yard line. I try to completely understand what they\u2019re trying to do. And once I\u2019ve done that, I feel entitled to be merciless if I want to, to be unkind. Or I sometimes see things that I didn\u2019t see before. I think there\u2019s more objectivity to the art of writing criticism than is generally perceived. It\u2019s not just a reaction to stimulus.\n\nDo you think that there\u2019s still a lingering perception that the book as a form considers itself more rarefied or apart from trashy television or Hollywood movies\u2014two things that I also love. How do you crack a book against a rating scale, the way you can with a new reality show?\n\nWhat\u2019s so interesting about fiction as a technology or what have you, is that it was the first middle-class art, because it was portable, it was cheap, you could go to the lending library. Whatever\u2019s easiest is going to be perceived as democratic. And whatever\u2019s difficult is going to be perceived as pretentious.\n\nI just don\u2019t believe any of that, I think people like what they like, they consume what they consume. And I don\u2019t have the mental energy to worry about people who don\u2019t like books and what they would think of my criticism. I\u2019m writing for someone who I assume cares, and enough of those people exist that even if I only make $500, it matters to me.\n\nI want to ask you about the money, because as you yourself just said, let\u2019s say you\u2019re going to get $500 for reviewing Ali Smith\u2019s Summer. Presumably, you\u2019re going to feel a particular responsibility to read the preceding three books that are part of the series of which it is the culmination. Is your work as a writer of fiction subsidizing your work as a critic, or are they two unrelated matters?\n\nWell, they\u2019re definitely not unrelated. I think the best year I ever had as a critic, I made $12,000 or $13,000 from criticism, and several multiples of that from my mystery novels, which are best sellers. I make my living on the mystery novels. That\u2019s why I write them in a way. What would you say your hourly rate of pay for your average review is?\n\nI\u2019m certain I would make more working in retail if you break it down to the hour. Of course, the particular luxury of being able to sit at home and read a book and opine on it doesn\u2019t compare with the sheer labor of delivering packages for UPS, say. They\u2019re two different jobs, and it\u2019s not that I value one more than the other, or that the society should value one more than the other. But because we live in a system that is so wholly defined by capital, it\u2019s impossible to really think about this endeavor as distinct from capital. Of course, in some ways it\u2019s a measure of privilege, right? I make a living as a novelist, as do you. So I don\u2019t have to worry about what I\u2019m billing as a freelance writer. That accrues, and I do totally fine.\n\nYou mentioned making $12,000 a year. There are a lot of freelance writers who would be like, that is so much money, because it is a lot of money for this particular endeavor. But it\u2019s not enough to live on in this country and this society. That is one of the forces against which the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s Emerging Writers Fellowship is pushing against. If that work is only accessible to somebody who doesn\u2019t need $12,000 a year, then that keeps a whole spectrum of minds and voices and intellects out of the business. And that\u2019s not a good thing.\n\nOne hundred percent. I think a lot of those people go into academia because they perceive it as a place with a more stable incentive structure. And that has turned out to be completely false. If you went and got an English Ph.D. this year, there were 75 jobs for 800 new candidates. There are systemic problems to all of this. I\u2019m not sure criticism is more or less implicated than any of them.\n\nTo listen to the full interview with Charles Finch, subscribe to Working on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or listen below.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:33.518921", "publish_date": "2020-09-28", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-28 20:34:41.592000+00:00", "publish_time": "20:34:41", "source": "slate", "title": "Why write book reviews?", "topics": ["book", "criticism", "dont", "work", "value", "finch", "trying", "reviews", "lot", "think", "write", "critic"]}
