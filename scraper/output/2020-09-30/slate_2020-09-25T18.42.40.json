{"authors": ["Jordan Weissmann"], "body": "During a rally to unveil his new, predictably thin and gimmicky health care agenda on Thursday, Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that his administration would send $200 gift cards in \u201cin coming weeks\u201d to 33 million senior citizens that they could use to pay for prescription drugs. \u201cNobody has seen this before,\u201d the president said, accurately. That Trump was publicly declaring his intent to bribe elderly voters just before an election using public money was lost on nobody. Less clear is how the president actually intends to execute this latest scheme, or if it\u2019s even the tiniest bit legal.\n\nThe $200 coupons appear to be a fallback plan, hatched after a deal between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription medicine prices collapsed earlier this month. The agreement, in which companies would have spent $150 billion to bring down out-of-pocket costs for consumers, fell apart after White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows demanded that drugmakers pay for $100 drug discount cards that the administration would then mail to voters before the election, as the New York Times reported. The companies balked for the understandable reason that participating in an obvious campaign ploy might create bad \u201coptics\u201c\u2014i.e. piss off the Democrats who could control Washington a few months from now.\n\nSo instead, the White House is taking unilateral action. Administration officials say they have legal authority to send out the gift cards under a statute that lets the Department of Health and Human Services run demonstration projects designed to test policy changes that might make Medicare more efficient and cost-effective without compromising anybody\u2019s health. But these pilot programs tend to be tiny, usually involve technical tinkering with things like payment structures for providers, and aren\u2019t supposed to launch before qualified experts weigh in on whether the goals and design of the experiment make a lick of sense. In this case, it seems like the administration is just going to backfill a justification for sending voters an October bonus. An official told the Wall Street Journal that \u201cthe discount-card plan may be designed to test whether it helps beneficiaries stick with their prescribed medication schedules.\u201c Note the may, which suggests they haven\u2019t actually come up with a firm, official rationale for the thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not obviously legal,\u201d Juliette Cubanski, the deputy director of the Kaiser Family Foundation Program on Medicare Policy, told me. \u201cBecause if you read the statute, it doesn\u2019t automatically lend itself to where you send a $200 payment to Medicare beneficiaries. It\u2019s intended to be used by the secretary of HHS for testing changes to provider payments. Not sending money to Medicare beneficiaries themselves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear where, exactly, the money to pay for this whole plan will come from. The cards are expected to cost $6.6 billion. But Medicare demonstration projects are typically supposed to be budget-neutral for the federal government. It\u2019s not explicit in the main statute, and there do seem to have been cases where they\u2019ve tested out entirely new benefits. But the general rule is stated in plain language right on the application that organizations like hospitals that want to participate in these pilot initiatives are required to fill out: \u201cMedicare-waiver-only demonstrations must be budget neutral. Budget neutrality means that the expected costs under the demonstration cannot be more than the expected costs were the demonstration not to occur.\u201d\n\nSo far, the White House is being wishy-washy on this point. On Thursday, the administration suggested it would offset the cost of its gift cards using savings from its recently announced \u201cmost favored nation\u201d plan, which is meant to lower drug costs by requiring drug companies to charge Medicare the same low prices they offer in other countries. But that proposal hasn\u2019t actually been implemented yet, which meant the administration was essentially saying it would borrow against theoretical future savings that might not materialize. Now, it\u2019s telling reporters that the cost won\u2019t actually be covered by the most favored nation proposal, and that it is just planning to spend out of Medicare\u2019s rapidly depleting trust fund (which could result in higher premiums for seniors down the line to cover the shortfall).\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the question of when seniors will actually get these cards, if ever. Trump initially suggested that they would go out to 33 million individuals fairly soon. But Inside Health Policy editor John Wilkerson suggests that might not be the case for everyone: \u201cWhite House officials now say that only some seniors will receive the $200 Medicare Part D gift cards before the election,\u201d he tweeted Friday. \u201cThe cards will be sent over a period of months.\u201d\n\nThe jokes write themselves:\n\nStarting with seniors in Florida and North Carolina, presumably. https://t.co/UGjodWXTCZ \u2014 John Arnold (@JohnArnoldFndtn) September 25, 2020\n\nJust undecided voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania for now. https://t.co/dzhzBVohOz \u2014 Shandon Fowler (@ShandonFowler) September 25, 2020\n\nI bet money that \"some seniors\" who get these card first (if anyone actually gets them) will just so happen to be seniors in select swing states. https://t.co/EY5K3D0Gxn \u2014 Jon Walker (@JonWalkerDC) September 25, 2020\n\nObviously, this is not the first time Trump has played fast and loose with federal regulations and Congress\u2019 power over the purse for the sake of his political goals. He\u2019s redirected money from the Pentagon to pay for his border wall. He used FEMA\u2019s spare disaster relief funds to pay for unemployment benefits. And now, discount cards. Back in the good old days of the Obama era, Republicans tended to get up in arms about this sort of thing. Most notably, they attempted to bring Obamacare crashing down by refusing to appropriate money for some of its crucial subsidies, then sued to stop the administration when it attempted fund them using money earmarked for other parts of the law. (After years in court, it turned out the Obama White House was basically vindicated). But now that their guy is getting legally creative so he can treat the federal budget as election-season walking-around money, it\u2019s crickets.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:32.587354", "publish_date": "2020-09-25", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-25 18:42:40.667000+00:00", "publish_time": "18:42:40", "source": "slate", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Scheme to Bribe Seniors With $200 Gift Cards Is Not Obviously Legal", "topics": ["seniors", "donald", "white", "legal", "actually", "medicare", "voters", "pay", "gift", "trumps", "cards", "house", "200", "scheme", "bribe", "money", "administration", "obviously"]}
