{"authors": ["Dahlia Lithwick"], "body": "No one would blame you if you didn\u2019t last through the entire 90-plus minutes of the first presidential \u201cdebate\u201d Tuesday night. It was like watching toddlers do battle over the tub of paste while the substitute kindergarten teacher ineffectually implores them to please not eat the paste. Joe Biden did his level best not to be dragged into the swirling miasma of Donald Trump\u2019s hellscape worldview, in which COVID is imaginary, violent city carnage at the hands of antifa is real, climate change simply isn\u2019t happening, a COVID vaccine is imminent, and the good and noble white supremacists of America are standing by to save us all. But Trump was very insistent in his lying. That\u2019s all he\u2019s got. Even the moderator, Chris Wallace, who didn\u2019t fact-check Trump\u2019s answers but asked fact-based questions, spent the bulk of his evening rooting around in Trump\u2019s brain, interrupting Trump\u2019s interruptions and on occasion shouting down Trump\u2019s shouting.\n\nIn pure George Lakoff terms, the whole event was thus a buffet of lie sandwiches, in which Trump stated one brazen falsehood after another, as both Wallace and Biden made their best efforts to toss a little truth mustard and lettuce around, at which point Trump interrupted to repeat or exaggerate the initial lies. But there was a moment, right at the end of the debate, about an issue that matters perhaps more than any other, at which Biden ably flipped that script. Wallace asked each candidate to weigh in on what they were \u201cprepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.

Instead, he urged his own supporters to \u201cgo into the polls and watch very carefully\u201d and reaffirmed that he was \u201ccounting\u201d on a conservative Supreme Court, with a newly confirmed Amy Coney Barrett, to crown him the winner if there are any problems with the \u201cballots.\u201d (Reader: There will be problems with the \u201cballots.\u201d) Pressed on the complete lack of evidence of fraud in mail-in balloting, Trump insisted that it is widespread and pervasive (ballots! In creeks! Sold by mailmen! In Philadelphia!) and promised \u201cthis is going to be a fraud like you\u2019ve never seen. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over.\u201d Trump and his attorney general have been pushing this all-out fabrication all summer, in an effort to have the election called early, before all mail-in ballots are counted, and also to depress voter confidence in the possibility that any general election can be conclusive or fair. Again, that\u2019s the point, and it\u2019s the only point: He doesn\u2019t want you to believe the election can be fair.\n\nHere was where Joe Biden did his best work of the evening. Instead of accusing Trump, Trump\u2019s postmaster general, Trump\u2019s attorney general, Trump\u2019s new Supreme Court nominee, or anyone else of outright stealing the election\u2014which has the effect of depressing the very voter confidence he needs to encourage\u2014Biden did almost precisely what communications expert Anat Shenker-Osorio has been suggesting voting advocates do in discussing \u201crigged elections\u201d: He made it clear that this is not Trump\u2019s election, but the voters\u2019. As Shenker-Osorio puts it in an interview with Rolling Stone: \u201cWhen he says I\u2019m not going to step down\u2014or the \u2018covfefe version\u2019 of that in his garbled way of talking\u2014instead of repeating him, Democrats should say, \u2018Over my dead body. You don\u2019t decide how long you\u2019re in this job. We do.\u2019 \u201d Her point is that instead of succumbing to the dispiriting possibility that Trump gets to cheat and steal the vote, refocus voters on their power to stop it. More from Shenker-Osorio:\n\nThe overarching thing is: Let\u2019s have our conversation. If Trump believes he\u2019s going to block us from deciding our next government, he\u2019s got another thing coming. We\u2019re turning out in record numbers and this will be a government by and for the people. If he needs to be ushered out of the White House by force, and that seems to be what he\u2019s asking for\u2014if need be, we\u2019ll deliver.\n\nThose are the threats and the taunts of a bully who knows he can\u2019t win fairly, and also a man absolutely terrified of the immense legal consequences of returning to civilian life.\n\nThat is precisely the tack Biden took when, faced with Trump\u2019s lies about millions of stolen ballots and fraudulent ballots and discarded ballots, he simply looked directly into the camera and named the game: \u201cThis is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he\u2019s trying to scare people into thinking that it\u2019s not going to be legitimate,\u201d Biden said. And then he built a seven-layer truth sandwich as he carefully outlined mail-in voting procedures, warned voters to allow time for every vote to be counted, described how to challenge invalidated ballots, and explained how the pandemic has complicated voting. Biden explained that Trump\u2019s own national security experts have discredited his mail fraud claims. The words echoed President Barack Obama\u2019s convention speech urging patience and confidence and determination in every voter. It was simple. Biden simply reminded everyone to just \u201cshow up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote whatever way is the best way for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause he will not be able to stop you from determining the outcome of this election.\u201d\n\nOf course Trump sputtered and lied and tried to frighten anyone watching into giving up. Nobody wants to see their ballot in a creek or sold by cunning postmen to George Soros. Or whatever. And of course Trump also laid the groundwork for the unavoidable challenge he will eventually bring to mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin or anywhere else the results are within the margin of litigation. But those are\u2014recall\u2014the threats and the taunts of a bully who knows he can\u2019t win fairly, and also of a man absolutely terrified of the immense legal consequences of returning to civilian life. Trump is going to say whatever he has to say and he is going to do whatever he has to do to avoid losing, and he just vomited up a greatest-hits album of his four-year-old claims about fraud. He isn\u2019t going to be persuaded by facts, Chris Wallace, his own appointees, or anyone else. What Biden was doing in response was reminding everyone that it\u2019s not Donald Trump or Bill Barr or Trump\u2019s poll watchers who will decide those facts. The voters themselves must shape the truth by voting in immense numbers while tuning out the fever dream. At that point the nightmare will end. As Vanita Gupta writes in the Washington Post:\n\nIf Trump loses, and wants to say the election wasn\u2019t fair, he can say what he wants. But there is a system in place that he doesn\u2019t control. A sitting president wields no direct power when it comes to how Americans vote. In nearly every state, local boards of election count the ballots. State election authorities verify these counts. Governors or secretaries of state certify that the final tally is correct. The electoral college does not depend on the president accepting the results. And a new Congress in January counts the tally transparently. There are firewalls that separate this process from the president\u2014firewalls he has no power to override.\n\nVoters still have courts\u2014which have by and large rejected his speculative and fraudulent claims about inherent fraud in voting by mail\u2014and voters still have the law itself, which makes it hard for presidents to pull off sloppy coups, as Josh Geltzer and I argued earlier this month. The real fight is in our heads. And our heads need to keep remembering that Trump\u2019s brain has been a garbage place to visit, and also that we don\u2019t have to live there after November.\n\nWhat Biden did on Tuesday that matters more than anything else was to remind us how to keep Donald Trump out of our heads in the weeks before the election. In the most technical, brass tacks formulation he could muster, he simply told everyone who wants to be counted how to do that and where to do that and why, if they in fact do that, Donald Trump will be gone in January. The debate was a misery to the extent we had to witness\u2014yet again\u2014broken truth, shattered norms, and needless, abusive cruelty that Trump acts out for his base on every stage and in every forum. But it was a triumph as a mechanism for reframing the idea of power and agency and hope, none of which Donald Trump controls, and none of which should be surrendered when it is needed most.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 23:09:51.875779", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 15:59:18.875000+00:00", "publish_time": "15:59:18", "source": "slate", "title": "Joe Biden\u2019s most important debate answer was on election security.", "topics": ["going", "answer", "ballots", "vote", "trump", "biden", "security", "joe", "trumps", "debate", "voting", "election", "important", "voters", "bidens", "say"]}
