{"authors": ["Matthew Dessem"], "body": "There\u2019s a long-standing myth that director John Frankenheimer\u2019s 1962 conspiracy thriller The Manchurian Candidate was pulled from release in response to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. That never happened\u2014the movie\u2019s theatrical release had already run its course by the time Kennedy was killed\u2014but it seems like something that might have happened, and better yet, it\u2019d be a good story if it had happened, which is more than enough to keep a conspiracy theory alive for decades. After the Sept. 11 attacks, a wide array of movies and television shows really did get the Manchurian Candidate treatment, as filmmakers delayed, canceled, or altered their work to remove references to terrorism or shots of the World Trade Center. It wasn\u2019t a question of censorship so much as it was just reading the room\u2014something the people behind Amazon Prime\u2019s spectacularly ill-timed new conspiracy thriller Utopia really should have considered.\n\nThe nature of that conspiracy plays very differently in 2020 than it did in 2013, and the results are catastrophic.\n\nThe show is a remake of the 2013 Channel 4 series written by Dennis Kelly. The original version was a brightly colored mixture of conspiracy theories and comic book violence, anchored by delightful scenery-chewing villainy from Stephen Rea, Geraldine James, and James Fox, as well as a memorable and disturbing performance from Neil Maskell in the role of an Anton Chigurh\u2013style weirdo killer. The new version, written by Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, swaps in an American cast that includes Jessica Rothe, Rainn Wilson, and John Cusack. Both versions of the show have the same plot engine: A group of comic book fans discover an unpublished manuscript for a graphic novel that they believe holds clues about the future, shadowy forces are also looking for the same manuscript, and eventually the comic book fans uncover a global conspiracy. So far, so run-of-the-mill.\n\nBut the nature of that conspiracy plays very differently in 2020 than it did in 2013, and the results are catastrophic. (Spoilers for both versions of Utopia follow.) As the characters discover, the reason the comic book contains clues to things that haven\u2019t yet happened is that it was drawn by one of the architects of a plan designed to stave off planetary collapse as the population rises and fossil fuels run out. Here\u2019s the plan:\n\n1. Convince the general public that there is an outbreak of a deadly new virus. To sell the story, poison or otherwise kill people, then attribute their deaths to the phony virus.\n\n2. Once the fake pandemic is up and running and the public is terrified, announce that there is a vaccine that can defeat the virus.\n\n3. With the help of global elites, NGOs, and world governments, inject everyone on the planet with this \u201cvaccine\u201d as quickly as possible.\n\n4. Surprise! The vaccine is designed to permanently sterilize all or all but a certain percentage of the people who take it. Sit back and relax as the global population drops from 7.8 billion to about 500 million in a single generation, ushering in a new era of plenty.\n\nGet Slate Culture in Your Inbox The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

We are in the middle of an actual pandemic, a staggering number of Americans sincerely believe that that pandemic is a politically motivated hoax, and an equally staggering number believed vaccines were harmful years before COVID-19 emerged. It\u2019s not the filmmakers\u2019 fault we\u2019re in this mess, it\u2019s not their fault so much of the public is superstitious and gullible, and it won\u2019t be their fault if Utopia gives some dumbass the confidence they need to quit wearing a mask and infect and kill you or the people you care about. Make whatever art you like\u2014the audience isn\u2019t your problem! But if you\u2019ve made something about a scrappy group of kids uncovering a giant conspiracy, and it turns out that in the time since you finished shooting, that exact conspiracy theory has suddenly revealed itself to be a) believed by a significant portion of the population and b) deadly, it might not be a bad idea to push the release date.\n\nEven if everyone who sees Utopia is capable of distinguishing fact from fantasy\u2014and that\u2019s vanishingly unlikely in a nation that is sending QAnon followers to Congress\u2014it\u2019s impossible to enjoy a story where the heroes persuade themselves that shadowy forces have manufactured a phony pandemic to trick people into taking a dangerous vaccine when those exact beliefs are helping to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. Every time the Utopia kids uncover another piece of the conspiracy, it\u2019s a new invitation to contemplate just how screwed we are. There\u2019s nothing wrong with extending that invitation, but it\u2019s better to do it intentionally, not as an accident of history.\n\nIf the country ever gets to the other side of this pandemic, there may come a time when Utopia can be appreciated for what it is: an inferior American copy of a pretty good British TV show. But 2020 is not that time. We wouldn\u2019t have to be living in a perfect society for Utopia to play the way it\u2019s supposed to, but we\u2019d need to build something better than this. If any shadowy elites have a plan to get us there, this is your moment.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:29.371807", "publish_date": "2020-09-25", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-25 21:30:21.956000+00:00", "publish_time": "21:30:21", "source": "slate", "title": "Amazon\u2019s Utopia remake should never have been released in 2020 (spoilers).", "topics": ["book", "conspiracy", "pandemic", "spoilers", "vaccine", "remake", "comic", "shadowy", "public", "signing", "released", "amazons", "2020", "utopia", "release"]}
