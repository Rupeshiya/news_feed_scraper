{"authors": ["Willa Paskin"], "body": "It is a commonly held belief that a good comedy should make you laugh. But what if a good comedy just makes you feel good? Apple TV\u2019s Ted Lasso, which stars Jason Sudeikis as a Southern-accented college football coach selected to run a Premier League soccer team, is that kind of show. Like Parks and Recreation and the Emmy-sweeping Schitt\u2019s Creek (plus a dollop of Major League), Ted Lasso is a big-hearted puppy dog of a series, an anti-cringe comedy where everything that seems like it might go wrong goes right instead. It\u2019s counterprogramming for the state of the world.\n\nTed Lasso himself is a variation on an American archetype you don\u2019t see much anymore, for obvious and painful reasons: the innocent na\u00eff, the pure-of-heart bumpkin, the uncultured savant. (The character originated in a series of promos for NBC\u2019s Premier League coverage.) The Brits have stiff upper lips, but Ted has a mustache you could take a nap in. Like some character out of 19th-century literature, he bounds into the U.K. to take over the middling London club AFC Richmond. It\u2019s a job he\u2019s landed because his jaded British boss Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham) took one look at him and thought: dopey American, perfect. Rebecca, coming off a painful divorce, is out to stick it to her ex by tanking the team, and she sees Ted as the perfect mark, a rube who won\u2019t guess her motivation. Floating on American na\u00efvet\u00e9, can-do spirit, and overconfidence, Ted thinks he just might be the man for the job, despite knowing next to nothing about soccer. The feel-good twist of the show, for Americans anyway, is: Of course he\u2019s the man for the job!\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

He bakes cookies for his boss, charms jaded newspaper men with his pure heart and willingness to eat food that\u2019s too spicy for him, and wins over his players with psychological insight. Though he is coded as a macho red-state American, he\u2019s basically the opposite. He doesn\u2019t care about winning and losing but how you play the game. He gets buy-in with enthusiasm, warmth, and folksy charm. The only things Ted doesn\u2019t seem to like are tea and tie games, such harmless things to make cracks about that they only underscore his all around affability. Meanwhile, the only person who finds Ted\u2019s relentless cheer off-putting is his wife, who wants a divorce. Her struggle with his near-pathological optimism is the only place in which the show hints at the truth: Yes, some people would find Ted Lasso annoying. On some other show, Ted Lasso is like the impossibly sunny colleague, always punning, who refuses to ever have a bad attitude. But that\u2019s not this show.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Ted: Every single person on the series is a teddy bear at heart. Rebecca only appears to be an ice princess, and by the time the the show literally has her sing \u201cLet It Go\u201d at karaoke, she has thawed, thanks both to Ted and the unexpected friendship of Keeley (Juno Temple), a 30-year-old WAG who is dating the club\u2019s best player but who turns out to be a delight: clever, insightful, generous with other women. Her boyfriend, Jamie (Phil Dunster), is a self-obsessed pretty-boy footballer who won\u2019t pass the ball\u2014but it\u2019s because of his daddy issues. Aging star Roy (Brett Goldstein) is always furious, but he turns out to actually be Oscar the Grouch, his growls and scowls covering up a heart of gold. The other coach, Coach Beard (Brendan Hunt)\u2014yes, this premiere league team has only two coaches at the outset\u2014is Ted\u2019s gentle, laconic, chess-playing right-hand man, and together they kindly give the equipment manager, Nate (Nick Mohammed), who no one has ever given the time of day, a chance to join their ranks. Ted, Coach Beard, Nate, and Higgins (Jeremy Swift), an executive who seems at first like a stuffed shirt in on Rebecca\u2019s scheme, but who turns out\u2014surprise!\u2014to be lovely, form a foursome, doling out locker-room advice to players about their feelings.\n\nProbably the worst thing you could say about Ted Lasso is that if you are looking for a sports show, it is relatively light on sports. Yes, there are long-awaited victories, injuries, and many trick plays, but the audience never really gets to know more than a handful of players. The show basically sees the world as Ted sees it: It\u2019s all about the relationships. A surprisingly large amount of screen time is taken up by women (especially given that the cast\u2019s gender breakdown is something like 25 to two), but that\u2019s because, again, sports are just Ted Lasso\u2019s setting, not its primary concern. That concern, as far as I can tell, is being lovely.\n\nAnd to be lovely right now\u2014it takes some thinking. Earlier this year Peacock began airing Intelligence, a British comedy starring David Schwimmer as an unbearably smug and overbearing American spy, bringing his idiot ego to an MI6 office. The show wasn\u2019t obviously awful or anything, but it\u2019s a difficult time to pass off excruciating and boorish American overreach as comedy. Ted Lasso has no such problems, because it operates squarely in the space of fantasy and flattery. The show vends a soothing vision of a red state\u2013coded American as a kindly, gentle internationalist, as well as a world in which American soft power still works and does good, and an underestimated, know-nothing American can teach a bunch of foreigners a thing or two about the Beautiful Game and the game of life. On Ted Lasso, American innocence, humility, and heroism are all alive and well\u2014and you don\u2019t have to consciously notice any of that for it to bring you comfort.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:25.847373", "publish_date": "2020-09-29", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-29 09:56:00+00:00", "publish_time": "09:56:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Ted Lasso: Jason Sudeikis\u2019 Apple TV series is a feel-good show that actually makes you feel good.", "topics": ["lasso", "series", "jason", "coach", "league", "feelgood", "american", "ted", "man", "wants", "tv", "sudeikis", "feel", "good", "makes", "comedy", "turns"]}
