But there\u2019s another concern: our overheating planet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has nominated 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett for Ginsburg\u2019s old spot. And some worry that a 6\u20133 conservative supermajority might mean that any policy to protect our planet from climate change will be struck down before it even gets started.\n\nTo state the obvious, a SCOTUS with a 6-3 conservative majority is going to strike down federal climate legislation of any ambition. It will probably also undercut several precedents that support *current* environmental laws & regulations. \u2014 David Roberts (@drvox) September 21, 2020\n\n\u201cEnvironmentalists are facing a real minefield ahead,\u201d said Robert Percival, director of the environmental law program at the University of Maryland. \u201cI have just been so depressed.\u201d\n\nIf Barrett and other conservative justices follow in Roberts\u2019 footsteps, the outcome could be catastrophic.\n\nFirst, some facts: The Supreme Court can\u2019t just go around striking down legislation and a president\u2019s executive orders left and right, but the court can make it much more difficult to implement laws or limit greenhouse gas emissions by: interpreting law narrowly, refusing to defer to institutions like the Environmental Protection Agency, and otherwise restricting presidential and congressional power. And now, with the potential for more conservative justices on the court than at any time in recent history, the odds that government actions survive Supreme Court scrutiny appear lower than ever.\n\nBarrett is a staunch conservative who\u2019s popular with the religious right. Not much is known about her environmental record, but if she follows in the footsteps of Trump\u2019s earlier appointments, she would join the conservative wing of the court in undermining existing environmental laws and blocking others.\n\nOne of the most important issues in environmental law is whether groups\u2014cities, states, and even young children\u2014have the right to sue the government to take action on climate change. To have \u201cstanding\u201d to sue, plaintiffs have to be able to prove a) that they have suffered some sort of harm, b) that injury is traceable to the action (or inaction) of the defendant, and c) that the result of the lawsuit would somehow rectify the damage done.\n\nThat poses a few problems for taking on the giant, global problem of climate change. A court tilted so far to the right might say that since climate change affects everyone, and global CO 2 emissions are hard to track and trace to particular defendants, a single state or city doesn\u2019t have standing to sue. Moreover, since no single action can truly \u201csolve\u201d climate change, conservative justices could argue that any lawsuit wouldn\u2019t rectify the harm caused, again demolishing plaintiffs\u2019 standing.\n\n\u201cI call it the Goldilocks theory of standing,\u201d said Percival. \u201cIf the harms aren\u2019t big enough, then you can\u2019t sue, but if the harms are so big, then you can\u2019t sue because it affects everyone!\u201d\n\nSome justices on the court, like John Roberts and Clarence Thomas, are already skeptical of whether groups have the right to sue the government over climate change. In Massachusetts v. EPA, a 2007 Supreme Court case in which 12 states and several cities called on the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, a 5\u20134 majority found that the plaintiffs did have standing\u2014but only one of the justices in that majority is still serving on the court. Chief Justice John Roberts, currently the court\u2019s swing vote, wrote a scathing dissent, arguing that global warming was \u201charmful to humanity at large\u201d and EPA regulation of greenhouse gases was unlikely to make a dent in the problem.\n\nIf Barrett and other conservative justices follow in Roberts\u2019 footsteps, the outcome could be catastrophic. \u201cLitigation brought by states and by environmental groups is very important\u2014for instance, in holding Trump\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d said Michael Gerrard, a professor of law at Columbia University. If these groups don\u2019t have the right to sue, then a hostile White House could gut more environmental laws and continue to ignore climate change, with nothing standing in its way.\n\nBack in 2014, foiled by Congress in his attempts to pass a sweeping climate change law, President Barack Obama turned to the EPA. The agency proposed the Clean Power Plan, which would have cut greenhouse gas emissions from the country\u2019s power plants by 30 percent in 15 years.\n\nIt should have worked: The EPA\u2019s right to regulate greenhouse gas emissions had been confirmed in Massachusetts v. EPA. But the Clean Power Plan got held up in the courts, as over two dozen (mostly red) states sued to block it. The Supreme Court, in a highly unusual move, supported those states, halting enforcement of the plan while the lawsuit worked its way through the courts, and effectively hamstringing the regulation until the end of Obama\u2019s term. (Trump later replaced the rule entirely.)\n\nA superconservative court with Barrett on board would likely give similar treatment to any executive action taking on climate change, ruling that large-scale regulations on greenhouse gas emissions are a step too far under the EPA\u2019s authority. That could pose a huge problem for the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who has promised to make the climate a centerpiece of his term if elected. Biden has pledged to get America\u2019s electricity grid running purely on clean energy by 2035\u2014basically triple the ambition of Obama\u2019s plan. If Democrats don\u2019t take control of the Senate (a toss-up at the moment), he would have to try to muscle regulation through the EPA. And that probably wouldn\u2019t end well.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one path to sweeping, Green New Deal\u2013esque climate action. The best-case scenario starts with Congress actually passing a bill, Gerrard said: \u201cMost of the litigation about climate change law that gets to the Supreme Court is on interpreting ambiguous statutes.\u201d But if Congress and the president adopt climate legislation and leave little room for interpretation, that won\u2019t leave much space for the Supreme Court to strike it down.\n\nEven that comes with caveats. According to Percival, there\u2019s a growing movement among conservative justices for expanding what is known as the \u201cnondelegation doctrine,\u201d through which laws can be struck down if they seem to hand too much power to executive agencies. That means if, say, Congress passes a law regulating greenhouse gas emissions but leaves it up to the EPA to parse out some of the details, the court could quash it. \u201cYou could see the court basically striking down some major environmental statutes,\u201d Percival said.\n\nSo if the Biden administration gets a clean energy law through Congress, it would have to be extremely detailed and avoid leaving too much for agencies to decide. Otherwise, it likely wouldn\u2019t survive a challenge that winds up in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nGerrard is still hopeful that, given the right conditions, legislation that passes the Senate and the House could hold up even under superconservative court scrutiny. \u201cIf the laws are clear and unambiguous and specific enough,\u201d he said, \u201cCongress ties the hands of the courts.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:25.946358", "publish_date": "2020-09-29", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-29 19:11:14.796000+00:00", "publish_time": "19:11:14", "source": "slate", "title": "Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation would be a climate disaster.", "topics": ["sue", "law", "confirmation", "environmental", "supreme", "change", "justices", "right", "barretts", "disaster", "court", "conservative", "climate", "coney", "amy"]}
