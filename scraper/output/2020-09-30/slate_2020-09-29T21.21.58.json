{"authors": ["Joshua Keating"], "body": "Anarchism is having a moment\u2014or at least the word is. President Donald Trump spent much of the summer blaming violence at protests around the country on \u201cradical-left anarchists.\u201d His election rival, Joe Biden, has made clear that while he supports peaceful protests, he strongly opposes \u201canarchists\u201d as well. Some of Trump\u2019s critics have suggested that with his disregard for the norms and institutions of American politics, he\u2019s the real anarchist. The A-word got its most dubious usage in September when Trump released a directive to federal agencies instructing them to find ways to withhold funding for designated \u201canarchist jurisdictions\u201d like the cities of Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and New York. The memo blamed Democratic city governments for allowing \u201canarchy, violence, and destruction in America\u2019s cities.\u201d\n\nThe designation was immediately met with scorn and ridicule\u2014the three cities are among the safest in the nation, for one thing. But perhaps because of recent state failures, there is something of an anarchist spirit in the air.\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.

Activists in Seattle maintained a police-free \u201cautonomous zone\u201d for several weeks. Leaderless protest movements are on the rise, while once-radical ideas for limiting the state\u2019s power, like defunding police forces and abolishing prisons, are gaining mainstream acceptance.\n\nTo discuss what anarchism really means, I spoke with James C. Scott, a professor of political science and anthropology at Yale. Scott has applied an \u201canarchist squint\u201d to politics and the study of peasant and nomadic societies in books like the classic Seeing Like a State and his recent critical history of agriculture, Against the Grain. In his 2014 book Two Cheers for Anarchism, he makes the case for an anarchist approach to both political activism and everyday life. We discussed the recent protests, how anarchism got such a bad name, and whether anarchism could ever get a Bernie Sanders\u2013style rebranding. This conversation has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.\n\nJoshua Keating: When you look at the leaderless anti-racist protest movements we\u2019ve seen in recent months, or the autonomous zones that have appeared in a couple of cities, do you see those as examples of anarchist practice?\n\nJames Scott: Yes. I think when Trump talks about antifa [the commonly used shorthand for anti-fascist activists], he imagines, I suppose, a kind of organization that is plotting and then directing from some command structure, telling its minions to go out and do this or that.\n\nIt seems to me that when you look at almost all of modern\u2014and I mean modern going back to the French Revolution\u2014progressive movements, social uprisings, almost all of them begin as grassroots phenomena without any leadership, or a leadership that grows organically from the streets.\n\nBy and large, it\u2019s not organizations that start movements. It\u2019s movements that, by their activity and growth, then precipitate out, if you like. Organizations then carry a legislative or an actual program forward, but the organizations are the product of an eruption of anger.\n\nThat was true for the civil rights movement with [the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]. It was true for all the wildcat strikes during the New Deal as well. It wasn\u2019t unions that created those strikes\u2014they erupted against union instructions by and large.\n\nWhy do you think there\u2019s this persistent use of anarchist as an epithet?\n\nI suppose it\u2019s two things. One of them, of course, is that it\u2019s not as if there wasn\u2019t, historically, a section of anarchism did believe in violence. The \u201canarchists of the deed\u201d had this idea that if you bombed train stations and prime ministers and parliaments and command structures of the military and so on, you could destroy the state. So it\u2019s not as if it there isn\u2019t a grain of truth about the history of anarchism deploying violence in a strategic way. But today it has just become a synonym for violence and chaos and the absence of order. It\u2019s a product, if you like, of a kind of a capitalist mindset, especially when it comes to the destruction of property.\n\nHow did your interest in anarchism first develop?\n\n\u201cIn most people\u2019s mouths it\u2019s just a synonym for chaos and violence.\u201d \u2014 James Scott\n\nIn two stages, I suppose. I used to teach courses on theories of peasant revolution. And there was a time when I worshipped at the altar of Ho Chi Minh and Mao and S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 and so on. And it dawned on me, of course, by looking more closely at them, and actually then reading a tremendous amount about the French Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution, that most revolutions ended up installing a state that was more oppressive than the state that they had destroyed. So, that was bracing.\n\nThen, when I was teaching courses on social change, I found myself saying things, which, in the back of my head, I thought, Hmm, that sounds like what an anarchist would say. And it happened enough times that I decided, well, I better make sure. I better teach a couple of courses on anarchism and read all the classics. And so that\u2019s how I came to make a deeper dive, if you like, into the arguments against the state for anarchism.\n\nBut, as you know, the reason my book is called Two Cheers is because there are aspects of anarchism that I don\u2019t agree with.\n\nSo you wouldn\u2019t describe yourself as an anarchist?\n\nNo, you could say I\u2019m a sympathizer. The problem is that while in most people\u2019s mouths it\u2019s just a synonym for chaos and violence, in fact, etymologically, it just means a kind of order without hierarchy. It seems to me that describes many of the most progressive and important structures of social protests historically.\n\nIn your book, you write a lot about figures like Martin Luther King and Jane Jacobs as examples of anarchist practice, even though people wouldn\u2019t normally identify them\u2014and they wouldn\u2019t identify themselves\u2014as anarchists. Are there more traditional anarchist movements we can learn from?\n\n\u201cThe formal organization is a product of an improvised explosion of anger.\u201d \u2014 James Scott\n\nOf course, during the Spanish Civil War, the Republican side was identifiably, in large parts, an anarchist movement emphasizing local autonomy and so on. The only postwar example that I think is extremely important is the Solidarity movement in Poland [in the 1980s]. It never had a centralized leadership. It depended on both rural and urban and labor and the middle class coming together voluntarily. And because of the widespread hatred for martial law under [President Wojciech] Jaruzelski, it was a tremendous success. That was a successful, peaceful, and anarchist revolution in the full meaning of the term.\n\nCan you explain what you mean by the \u201canarchist squint\u201d?\n\nThe point of the anarchist squint is to show how much social action actually depends on this heterogeneous coming together of people whose anger has many of the same targets. This action depends on popular improvisation by a large number of people who don\u2019t have the same objectives in mind, nor a formal means of agreeing on exactly what to do.\n\nI think, for example, of things like desertions from Napoleon\u2019s army, or by poor white soldiers from the Confederate forces during the Civil War\u2014people defected as whole units. The same is true for squatting. Squatters don\u2019t announce their objectives. They just squat and then maybe move out when they\u2019re threatened and then move back again.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement now has spokesmen we can listen to on the cable news. But Black Lives Matter was precipitated out of Black anger on the streets over time. And the formal organization is a product of an improvised explosion of anger.\n\nOver the years you\u2019ve been teaching these topics, have you noticed an increasing interest in anarchism?\n\nI haven\u2019t taught formal anarchism for some time, but when I taught the course, I was astounded by the number of people who turned up. I used to say during those three years during which I taught courses on anarchism, if you dropped a bomb on my class, you would have destroyed the Yale undergraduate left.\n\nAnd now I think it\u2019s actually partly because people are particularly concerned about the technology for state control through the use of personal information. I think we know a fair amount about how far this is going in China, with facial recognition technology and so on, in the Uighur areas. So people are paying attention, if you like, to Leviathan.\n\nAnd now it seems to me that the kind of control that the state has at its command is far more granular and microtargeted.\n\nIs there a way to rehabilitate anarchism for the general public?\n\nI guess one reason why you called me is the way in which anarchism has just become an insult to hurl, and it\u2019s actually quite effective. It\u2019s not as if I imagine I\u2019m going to take the rest of the American public to a little seminar for three hours and convince them that anarchism isn\u2019t such a bad thing, even if there\u2019s more of an appetite now.\n\nIt\u2019s a little like the process by which Eastern European command economies gave socialism a bad name, and then it became an insult. In fact, much of what the public would like to have happen in public life, in terms of legislation and security and so on, has historically gone under the name of socialism. And yet when you call it socialism, it implies that thought control and a command economy and everybody telling you what to do. Whereas capitalism still has a relatively good name, to the point where Elizabeth Warren calls herself a capitalist.\n\nWell, that raises the question. There\u2019s been a rehabilitation of socialism\u2019s brand in American politics lately, thanks to Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others. Could there ever be a \u201cDemocratic Anarchists of America\u201d?\n\n[Laughs] There could be, but as you appreciate, democratic socialism is not a contradiction in terms. A formal organization called the Democratic Anarchists of America is at the edge of being self-contradictory: The \u201cpresident of the Anarchist Association\u201d and the \u201cboard of trustees of the Anarchist Association of America\u201d\u2014it somehow doesn\u2019t sound right. It\u2019s better as a practice than as a label.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:27.318523", "publish_date": "2020-09-29", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-29 21:21:58.896000+00:00", "publish_time": "21:21:58", "source": "slate", "title": "\u201dAnarchist jurisdictions\u201d: James Scott on the use and misuse of the term \u201canarchism.\u201d", "topics": ["movements", "formal", "term", "anarchists", "james", "anarchism", "scott", "state", "anarchist", "misuse", "think", "violence", "socialism", "command", "jurisdictions"]}
