{"authors": ["Riley Black"], "body": "The puppies are everywhere. I see them every day as I take my six-year-old German shepherd, Jet, out for his daily walk along the tree-lined sidewalks near downtown Salt Lake City. Little labs, shepherds, border collies, and more, all happily snuffling and wagging along the sidewalk as they trot along with their new families. Shelters and breeders alike have been understandably swamped this year, with people trying to bring meaning and joy to our time in quarantine. Each pandemic puppy we see is absolutely adorable\u2014and also poised to become a huge problem for the people who adopted them to be little rays of sunshine during the interminable pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think that people anticipate a special kind of interspecies companionship with dogs,\u201d says Julie Hecht, a PhD candidate in animal behavior at the City University of New York. They\u2019re not wrong: our dogs are closely attuned to us, from how we feel to what we do, and having a furry friend who\u2019s always happy to see you\u2014or, maybe more accurately during the early days of COVID, stay glued to your side \u2013 can certainly make stressful situations easier. But now that some communities are experimenting with going back to school or work, veterinarians and behavioral specialists are starting to see emerging problems among our pups. And if you\u2019ve had trouble navigating all the changes with recent life, imagine how hard that is for your dog.\n\nThe problem is that the pandemic puppies are too bonded with us. \u201cPuppies are the focus of the family,\u201d says veterinarian Laura McLain of Holladay Veterinary Hospital in Utah. That goes double during the pandemic. During life before, a growing puppy would have to get used to people coming and going during the day, or even having the house to themselves for a bit. And while we could rely on dog walkers, daycare, and training schools to entertain and socialize our dogs in the Before Times, suddenly we became our dogs\u2019 whole world. \u201cEarly life socialization is about helping young animals join the world win which they\u2019re going to live,\u201d Hecht says. The pandemic puppies have been unknowingly conditioned for a world in which they\u2019re always with us.\n\nConstant companionship doesn\u2019t necessarily make life less stressful for dogs, though. If all they know is us, much of the world may seem alarming\u2013especially during trips to the vet. Pandemic puppies adopted in April and May are getting old enough to be spayed and neutered. But during the post-op care, McLain and her colleagues noticed something strange. Many of the puppies react with fear and aggression when the doctors go to put the infamous cone of shame on the dogs after surgery, the pups flailing, biting, and otherwise reacting violently with a frequency never seen before. It\u2019s difficult to tell for sure without being able to talk to the dogs themselves, but, McLain says, it may be a symptom of that lack of socialization. The fear is probably made all the worse by the fact that we still need to social distance at the vet\u2019s office, and the fact that everyone is wearing masks\u2014a challenge for animals that are attuned to our faces and expressions.\n\nOur dogs also aren\u2019t used to being left alone. As we ease out of life in lockdown, they\u2019re being left to hang out without us for stretches of time, perhaps for the first time in their lives. \u201cPandemic aside, changes to daily routines can affect dogs negatively,\u201d Hecht says, especially when we don\u2019t realize that our dogs need some help and patience navigating the changes. New absences can be a trigger for separation anxiety. That\u2019s true for older pups, too, even if the dogs aren\u2019t totally alone. I recently planned an overnight trip to Arches National Park, where there are no dogs allowed. On the morning I left, I didn\u2019t even get to the highway before I started getting messages from my girlfriend. Jet, typically independent enough, had started acting strange, jumping on the bed and woofing right in my girlfriend\u2019s face, trotting out to search the apartment for me as soon as she let him out of the bedroom. I hadn\u2019t thought about the fact that I\u2019d barely been out of his sight or nose since March. Morning family walks had become the daily routine. It didn\u2019t matter that I said \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon\u201d and pet his ears before I left. To me, I was just taking a little break\u2013he\u2019d obviously have lots of fun with his other mom. To him, I had abruptly changed a pattern I\u2019d inadvertently set over the course of months.\n\nDogs can make such good, intuitive companions that it\u2019s easy to forget that, in fact, they\u2019re dogs. They don\u2019t experience or understand the world the way we do. Certainly not all puppies will develop behavior problems or become aggressive, but the dramatic shifts in our lives mean we have to be sensitive to how our companions react, too. Like our own social skills, theirs might be weird and frayed right now. Dealing with separation anxiety, especially, requires patience, trying techniques like leaving and returning at two minute intervals, then five, then twenty, and so on until our dog understands that we will come back and the sky won\u2019t fall.
