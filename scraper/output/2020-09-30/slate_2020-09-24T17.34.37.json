That essay, published in January 2019, went megaviral. So naturally, Petersen then wrote a book on burnout, which was published on Tuesday. If this sounds like a short turnaround for a full book, Petersen agrees. In her newsletter, she presents herself as a martyr for the cause: She began book leave in early June 2019, writing in a newsletter entry that the work was \u201cabsolutely going to give me burnout while writing a burnout book.\u201d By Aug. 18 of that year, she\u2019d submitted a draft, 78,909 words long, and in September, she was back traveling and writing for BuzzFeed, meaning she had to complete revisions on the book at night and on weekends. \u201cI\u2019m going to burn out again during the editing process,\u201d she lamented. But she pushed forward so that the book could be released into the \u201cpissed off, dissatisfied\u201d energy prior to the November 2020 election and also\u2014she\u2019s not shy about hinting at this\u2014have the best chance of being a hit.\n\nAt its best, Can\u2019t Even: How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation succeeds in making its case for overhauling society as a means of addressing the deep, personal exhaustion that afflicts many of us. It can be read as a recent history of work in America, one that rightly and horrifyingly emphasizes how taxed and ill-supported many, many, many people are in this country. There are facts in this book that make me feel enthused about voting, to the extent that I have any remaining capacity to be more enthused about voting. For example: \u201cIn 1950, CEOs made about 20 times more than the regular employee, by 2013, they made more than 204 times more.\u201d That\u2019s from a chapter titled \u201cOur Burnt Out Parents.\u201d The book attempts to evade a main criticism of the viral essay\u2014that its focus on millennials as the \u201cburnout generation\u201d ignores the related plights of everyone else\u2014by occasionally noting that obviously everyone is, to some extent, burned out.\n\nThe idea that other generations were burned out too is somehow used as supporting evidence for the title thesis. In a chapter titled \u201cHow Work Got So Shitty,\u201d Petersen explains a \u201970s temp agency that advertised \u201cKelly Girls\u201d\u2014secretaries and typists who could fill in at a moment\u2019s notice and even came with a money-back guarantee\u2014as the clear prototypes of the gig workers who don\u2019t require vacation days or dental care today. Still, \u201cHow Work Got So Shitty\u201d is the best chapter because it offers a clear evolution on how pay declined as expectations and surveillance at work rose. This is the best supporting evidence for the argument that millennials are indeed more burned out than anyone else. It\u2019s also the chapter in which I learned what consultants do\u2014figure out how to reduce jobs and lay people off!\n\nIn the book\u2019s concluding chapter, \u201cBurn It All Down,\u201d Petersen delivers a call to action. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be this worried, this terrified, this anxious, about everything,\u201d she writes. This sentence is accurate, and feels truer now in a post-RBG coronavirus-laden end-of-democracy-impending America than it possibly could have in January, when Petersen was finishing up edits on the book. (COVID-19 is confined to an author\u2019s note at the beginning, which feels less weird than I expected it would.) Petersen briefly lays out the solution:\n\nWe can unite in our resistance to the way things are. We can refuse to blame ourselves for wide-scale societal failures \u2026 we can recognize that it\u2019s not enough to try to make things better for ourselves. We have to make things better for everyone. Which is why actual substantive change has to come from the public sector\u2014and we must vote en masse to elect politicians who will agitate for it tirelessly.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

Notably, Petersen does not give instructions on whom to vote for, or what new ways we might \u201cunite in our resistance,\u201d after a solid four years of attempting to \u201cunite in our resistance.\u201d In some ways, the book itself feels like an artifact of resistance culture: yet another call to an undefined action, swathed in a pretty cover. There\u2019s even matching swag: Those who preordered Can\u2019t Even received a planner that said \u201cThis Won\u2019t Fix Your Burnout\u201d and were eligible to win a crew neck sweater with \u201cCapitalism Is Broken\u201d tastefully stitched on the upper chest as well as a tote that says \u201cF*ck Passion, Pay Me\u201d (censorship is the tote\u2019s). Still, as I read Can\u2019t Even, I was bolstered by the idea that maybe this book will help people blame themselves a little less and fight for systemic change a little more. Coming at the close of a different book, a passionate-if-vague rallying cry might have left me feeling personally galvanized, eager to recommend Can\u2019t Even to everyone I know. After all, who does know what to do right now? It can feel good to just yell.\n\nInstead, the main feeling I had reading Can\u2019t Even was one of annoyance. Like the viral essay that came before it, Can\u2019t Even insists that burnout is an affliction that is most likely to affect you based on what years you were born, as opposed to, say, the result of some intersection of generational wealth, gender, subjugation to racism, and, yes, the particular level of technological surveillance hell under which your job takes place. (Older generations can suffer this too, by the way.) It repeatedly acknowledges that, yes, everyone is burned out; yes, marginalized people are more burned out\u2014a chapter on parenting emphasizes that raising kids, and the resulting parenting burnout, is typically the purview of women. It quotes writer Tiana Clark\u2019s response to the original viral essay: \u201cNo matter the movement or era, being burned out has been the steady state of black people in this country for hundreds of years.\u201c It even notes in the emergency COVID author\u2019s note that \u201cthe overarching clarity offered by this pandemic is that it\u2019s not any single generation that\u2019s broken or fucked or failed.\u201d But in a have-your-big-thesis-and-whack-it-over-the-head-too situation, it of course argues that millennials are \u201cthe burnout generation.\u201d\n\nThis book simplifies its message for an understandable reason. Can\u2019t Even isn\u2019t just a history or a call to action\u2014it\u2019s a rebuttal. \u201cMillennials are burned out\u201d is a rejoinder to \u201cMillennials are lazy,\u201d or, as Petersen puts it, a response to the \u201cboomer refrain\u201d of \u201cstop whining, millennials\u2014you don\u2019t know what hard work is.\u201d To argue directly against the idea that millennials are lazy, you first have to accept that it is an evidence-based argument based on a meaningful pattern of millennial behavior, rather than, perhaps, an ad hoc insult sputtered through the haze of someone\u2019s own exhaustion and need to feel superior. Nevertheless, Petersen takes the accusation at face value, agreeing that we are sort of incompetent, unable to keep up with basic errands or remove ourselves from the lull of our phone screens. She would just like to clarify that our apparent shortcomings are not because of laziness\u2014nor, apparently, are they the result of structural oppressions that have existed in some form or another for centuries\u2014but because of burnout, a new affliction plaguing a newly adult generation.\n\nThe book includes large first-person sections on Petersen\u2019s own experience as a millennial. In sections where she uses the first-person plural\u2014we millennials\u2014her portrait of the millennial becomes clear, and it\u2019s cartoonish. The book posits that \u201cit\u2019s not enough to hang out\u201d with friends but \u201cthere has to be a purpose,\u201d not that we even have time to hang out with friends beyond group texts (group texts, another place where there is no fun to be had), because \u201cfinding time when everyone\u2019s schedules align means planning four months in advance.\u201d We don\u2019t date much because \u201cdating deters from the time you could be working.\u201d If, in an open-office plan, you put on headphones, you\u2019ll be met with \u201csuggestions that you\u2019re a cold bitch.\u201d We are beholden to Instagram, where \u201cwe post, therefore we are.\u201d To advertise one\u2019s intelligence, in addition to staying atop all the highbrow cultured stuff, one also feels pressure to know \u201cthe plot turns of the entire Real Housewives franchise.\u201d If this is hyperbole, it didn\u2019t register for me.\n\nPetersen concludes a chapter on how the likes of Instagram and Slack grind us into the ground by making millennials (specifically, her) set sky-high expectations for themselves:\n\nI need to be an insanely productive writer and be funny on Slack, and post good links on Twitter and keep the house clean and cook a fun new recipe from Pinterest, and track my exercise on MapMyRun and text my friends to ask questions about their growing children and check in with my mom and grow tomatoes in the backyard and shower and put on cute clothes for that thirty minute video call with my coworkers and and and and.\n\nBut does she, really? Petersen later writes that \u201cburnout occurs when the distance between the ideal and the possible lived reality becomes too much to bear.\u201d If our problem is that we\u2019re striving for an ideal that\u2019s unrealistic, one set forth by social media, there\u2019s some adjustment of personal values that can be done. But instead of modifying the ideal for herself by calling for broad acceptance of boring jobs and shitty Instagram posts, or for no Instagram posts and certainly no tomatoes, Petersen instead suggests that nothing can be changed until all of society changes.\n\nThis is the crux of the issue. There are certainly situations Petersen identifies that are real problems that cannot be fixed by merely lowering your expectations. Access to health care or a living wage is not an \u201cideal\u201d\u2014these things are necessities. But so much of this book is focused on things that are goals, not essentials. And I couldn\u2019t help but feel that the reason burnout seems so salient now might simply be because white people like Petersen\u2014who were promised that we would not only be economically and socially secure but also successful\u2014are facing a future in which we\u2019re less successful than our parents were.\n\nThe thing is, burnout is, in many ways, a mental health issue. Though Petersen doesn\u2019t mention it, it is a twin of depression. And for many people, the things causing it could be addressed in therapy. (Yes, access to therapy is uneven and expensive\u2014this is another way that burnout differs meaningfully by class.) But Petersen pretty much ignores therapy as an option, for anyone, but certainly for herself. She dismisses solutions for personal adjustment of one\u2019s values and goals (and corresponding work habits) as \u201cjust another way, in the end, for me to fail myself.\u201d Which I think is why this book left me not galvanized, but frustrated. The desire to push for systemic change absent a plan\u2014or regard for one\u2019s own well-being in the meantime\u2014just isn\u2019t a very durable way to fix anything.
