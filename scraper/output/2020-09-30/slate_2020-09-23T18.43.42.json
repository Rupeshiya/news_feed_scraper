{"authors": ["Seth Stevenson"], "body": "The following article is a written adaptation of an episode of Thrilling Tales of Modern Capitalism, Slate\u2019s new podcast about companies in the news and how they got there.\n\nIf you tour the motorcycle exhibits at Smithsonian\u2019s American History Museum, you\u2019ll see quite a bit of notable memorabilia, including that of stunt riding legend Evel Knievel.* The daredevil biker donated some genuine artifacts from his career to the Smithsonian, including the 1972 Harley-Davidson XR-750 on which he performed some of his most famous jumps. That piece of history is now one of the crown jewels of the Smithsonian\u2019s motorcycle collection.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why: Harley-Davidson is one of those storied brands, like Levi\u2019s or Coca-Cola, that represent America to itself and to the rest of the world. But over the past few years, Harley\u2019s traditional strengths, including this quintessential Americanness, have become its biggest liabilities.\n\nIt goes back to Donald Trump. The arrival of a new president with a fixation on American manufacturing seemed like good news for Harley: Company executives were invited to the White House less than a month after Trump\u2019s inauguration. It seemed like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. But being a symbol of America turned out to be a problem for Harley when Trump began trade wars with other parts of the world. In 2018, when Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on European steel, Europe wanted to strike back, looking to hurt something that represented America. According to Gabrielle Coppola, who covers automakers for Bloomberg News, Europe\u2019s mindset ended up being, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do that to us, we\u2019re going to place a tariff on imported Harley motorcycles.\u201d\n\nThat tariff would have added thousands of dollars to the cost of buying a Harley in Europe, but only if that Harley were made in America. So Harley started making more bikes in Thailand to sidestep the tariff\u2014which meant Trump\u2019s effort to protect American manufacturing, \u00e0 la Ronald Reagan in 1982, had the opposite effect. As a result of that, Coppola says, Harley \u201cwent from being this darling of Trump\u2014because they represent American manufacturing and history and heritage\u2014to, in his eyes, not supporting that narrative and his trade policy. So that caused some brand trauma. There are a lot of Harley riders that are Trump supporters because one of the main values of the brand is riders say, \u2018I want to buy American.\u2019 So anything that insults or dents that image is bad for them.\u201d\n\nHarley found itself paying a price for being a treasured piece of Americana. And, at the same moment, it also found itself paying the price for its longtime romance with the baby boomer generation. The boomers who long to take to the highway with Peter Fonda haven\u2019t abandoned Harley, but they\u2019re causing the company problems in a few ways. Because boomers are its core customers, Harley caters to them almost exclusively. At this point, that means making huge, comfy touring bikes, which are more expensive to buy, and good for Harley\u2019s profit margins, but not a winning play in the long term. Plus, boomer motorcyclists keep getting older. Some have quit riding; some are no longer here. Either way, Harley can\u2019t count on their business forever. Yet the company has been desperate to hang onto older customers. The downside of that: Younger riders prefer cheaper, sportier bikes, and Harley hasn\u2019t focused enough on that segment of the business to make it work.\n\nThe result has been an accelerating death spiral. The beginning of 2020 saw the company\u2019s worst sales numbers in 16 years. And that was before the pandemic, during which dealerships started to shutter. All those dismal results led Harley\u2019s CEO to step down and a longtime board member, Jochen Zeitz, to fill in. Zeitz is different from previous Harley CEOs: He\u2019s German, making him the first non-American to lead Harley, and he comes from the footwear industry, having gained prominence for lifting Puma from bargain bin sneaker to stylish fashion brand. Harley boosters are hoping that Zeitz\u2019s marketing aplomb can do the same thing for Harley that it did for Puma: give a moribund brand some new cachet.\n\nHe\u2019s already working on it. Zeitz\u2019s play has been to cut costs and slow down production, in part by eliminating more than 700 jobs. In the short term, he needs to get Harley\u2019s bleeding under control, but in the longer term, he has a bigger problem: How can he reshape Harley\u2019s brand so it can appeal to people under 50? And who will those new younger customers be?\n\nPart of this will be about marketing and image shaping. Harley\u2019s now trying to reach beyond white guys with tattoos\u2014it now has ads featuring people of color with professional incomes. And part of it will be about making new products that these new customers really want. Harley\u2019s first stab is the LiveWire. It\u2019s an amazing machine in many respects, an electric-powered motorcycle that goes from zero to 60 faster than any bike Harley has made before. But, starting just under $30,000, it\u2019s at least three times more expensive than most sporty entry-level bikes. And, it\u2019s a radical departure from the gasoline-soaked divide that Harley spent more than a century cultivating. Reconciling the electric bike with the Harley brand is little tough\u2014it doesn\u2019t quite seem on brand for Harley, with its roaring growling combustion engine. How will Harley make that fit its image?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real marketing challenge,\u201d says Coppola. \u201cJochen thinks it\u2019s great\u2014he says, Who would ever think that our Harley rider would want an electric bike? But when you ride it and you feel it, it\u2019s totally Harley. I don\u2019t know if everybody agrees with that. It\u2019s quiet, and I think the people that want the growl are always going to want the growl.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode using the player below, or subscribe to Thrilling Tales of Modern Capitalism on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:32.920287", "publish_date": "2020-09-23", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-23 18:43:42.607000+00:00", "publish_time": "18:43:42", "source": "slate", "title": "Harley-Davidson went from Trump\u2019s favorite motorcycle to an American pariah.", "topics": ["motorcycle", "harley", "trump", "making", "brand", "customers", "bikes", "pariah", "american", "favorite", "america", "harleydavidson", "trumps", "went", "harleys", "think"]}
