{"authors": ["Elliot Hannon"], "body": "There will be many, many real polls and opinions about what happened Tuesday night when, for the first time, President Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden shared the same stage. But for now, let\u2019s enjoy the responses of veteran GOP pollster Frank Luntz\u2019s Zoom focus group of 15 undecided voters in swing states. Immediately after the debate came to a close, Luntz sprung to action conducting digitally (this year) what is normally done in a blank room in a business park somewhere in the suburbs of an anodyne American city.\n\nBy Luntz\u2019s count, the most [insert adjective] debate in American history left nine (nine!) focus group participants still undecided. One, who did not remain undecided was nouveau American icon \u201cRuthie from Pennsylvania,\u201d who unleashed a real corker of the internet age, describing Trump\u2019s debate performance as trying to \u201cwin an argument with a crackhead.\u201d When the rest of the undecideds\u2014nine of which were men and six women\u2014were asked to use actual words to describe the two candidates and their performance Tuesday night, this is what they had to say (via Politico):\n\nDespite their indecisiveness, most described Trump in a negative light, including one of the participants who was leaning toward voting for the president. The voters characterized Trump as \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cforceful,\u201d a \u201cbully,\u201d \u201cchaotic\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d When asked to describe Biden they offered: \u201cbetter than expected,\u201d \u201cpolitician,\u201d \u201ccompassion,\u201d \u201ccoherent,\u201d and a \u201cnice guy lacking vision.\u201d\n\nCoherent! Nice guy lacking vision! Not exactly a slam dunk endorsement, but better than the alternative. Slap it on a bumper sticker and let\u2019s get voting!", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:30.614915", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 12:42:34.991000+00:00", "publish_time": "12:42:34", "source": "slate", "title": "Words Voters Used to Describe Trump\u2019s Debate Performance: \u201cCrackhead,\u201d \u201cUn-American,\u201d \u201cUnhinged\u201d", "topics": ["unamerican", "performance", "words", "trump", "voting", "crackhead", "president", "voters", "used", "american", "trumps", "participants", "undecided", "unhinged", "debate", "real"]}
