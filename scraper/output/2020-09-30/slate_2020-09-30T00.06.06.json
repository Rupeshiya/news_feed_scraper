{"authors": ["Heather Schwedel"], "body": "On Sunday, President Donald Trump \u201cstrongly demanded\u201d that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, be drug tested for Tuesday\u2019s debate. Only drugs could explain why \u201cSleepy Joe Biden\u201d sometimes wasn\u2019t so sleepy at all, Trump alleged. If it initially sounded like the president may have been referring to another drug that was famously popular in his heyday in 1980s New York, a surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, clarified things on Fox & Friends on Tuesday morning. He claimed that Biden \u201chas dementia. There\u2019s no doubt about it. I\u2019ve talked to doctors\u201d\u2014and then added: \u201cThe president\u2019s quite right to say maybe [Biden]\u2019s taken Adderall.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest Biden is actually on any drugs, legal or otherwise. But purely hypothetically: Would Adderall really do what Giuliani (and by implication, Trump) claims? What kind of miracle drugs does Trump think Biden would need here? Slate spoke to Michael T. Swanoski, a professor at the University of Minnesota\u2019s College of Pharmacy, to get into what is and isn\u2019t scientifically possible. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nHeather Schwedel: How would a drug like Adderall affect someone\u2019s debate performances?\n\nMichael T. Swanoski: Adderall is a stimulant that\u2019s often prescribed for attention deficit disorder. So Adderall potentially could increase your attentiveness if you\u2019re feeling drowsy or if you\u2019re fatigued. But it doesn\u2019t increase cognition per se. It doesn\u2019t improve thinking, but it provides a boost similar to what you\u2019d get from a cup of coffee\u2014a little more pronounced, but not increasing cognition in any way. It wouldn\u2019t have an effect on your acetylcholine, which is the chemical that\u2019s connected with clear thoughts, thinking through a difficult task, and high-level thinking.\n\nWhat other kind of drugs would take a person from sleepy to wide awake, so to speak?\n\nThere\u2019s been a push in marketing nutritional supplements that are touted for improving brain health or memory. They make vague claims of brain enhancer or memory enhancer without really getting too specific, because they\u2019re not allowed to make claims that they can\u2019t back up. But there\u2019ve certainly been cases of students using stimulants to help, maybe if they\u2019ve got a big exam, to make them more alert potentially. People are purchasing these products with the hope that they\u2019ll help them with giving them a competitive edge, perhaps in their job or whatever they need to think about.\n\nWould those show up in a drug test?\n\nWhether a nutritional supplement would show up in the urine is questionable. If you had amphetamine in your urine, that would show up.\n\nTrump seems to be implying that there\u2019s a drug that could magically make someone who was frail and confused into a brilliant debater. Is that possible?\n\nInherently your talents in debating are not going to suddenly be enhanced because you took a nutritional supplement or you took a prescription stimulant. The best they can do is maybe make you more alert. They\u2019re not going to suddenly increase your intelligence. That\u2019s just not possible.\n\nTrump has been pretty vague, but on Fox News, Rudy Giuliani has gone so far as to say Biden has dementia. There\u2019s a difference between normal cognitive decline and actual dementia, right?\n\nThere is a difference. As we age, our mental acuity or intelligence, they\u2019re all still there. Forgetting someone\u2019s name is not unusual, but if you forget where you live or where you\u2019re going, it\u2019s really a more pronounced loss of memory and cognitive function. With normal aging, there\u2019s occasional short-term memory lapses here and there, but it\u2019s not profound enough to really impact us. You look at someone like Judge [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg, who was almost 90 years old. She was highly intellectual and exercised her brain, and maybe she had some symptoms of forgetting where she put her keys, but her high level of cognition was still intact. Not everybody who ages gets dementia.\n\nGiuliani also said \u201cthe president\u2019s quite right to say maybe [Biden has] taken Adderall,\u201d implying it would be a treatment for his supposed \u201csleepiness.\u201d\n\nDementia is not lack of energy; there\u2019s damage going on in the brain. There\u2019s neural damage that occurs that then impairs the function of these neural transmitters, these chemicals like acetylcholine, which is this chemical that\u2019s really responsible in large part for our normal cognitive function. And so someone with dementia would not be treated with amphetamines to get them more alert. It wouldn\u2019t increase their brain acuity at all. It would make them jittery, more confused, really, because they wouldn\u2019t be able to think clearly. Drugs for dementia are primarily aimed at increasing levels of acetylcholine, like Donepezil, which is used for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\n\nSo just to be clear, you\u2019re saying that Adderall is not a treatment for dementia?\n\nYou are correct.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:29.734082", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 00:06:06.424000+00:00", "publish_time": "00:06:06", "source": "slate", "title": "Joe Biden drug test: A pharmacist on Trump's bizarre theory about Adderall and dementia.", "topics": ["brain", "drug", "theres", "youre", "theory", "test", "bizarre", "drugs", "biden", "trumps", "adderall", "pharmacist", "really", "joe", "dementia", "maybe"]}
