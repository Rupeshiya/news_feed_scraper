In the interview, Charles discusses the impact of platforms like Goodreads (where anyone can be a critic) and explains why it\u2019s so hard for people to make a living writing book reviews. He also talks about how a book\u2019s popularity can affect his response to it and how it\u2019s possible to get burned out from writing too many reviews.\n\nAfter the interview, Rumaan and co-host Isaac Butler discuss their relationships to criticism, as people who both write reviews and produce creative work.\n\nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com.\n\nPodcast production by Cameron Drews.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:32.414562", "publish_date": "2020-09-27", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-27 10:00:00+00:00", "publish_time": "10:00:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Critic Charles Finch on Reading Hundreds of Books a Year", "topics": ["write", "book", "criticism", "writing", "books", "interview", "charles", "finch", "reviews", "rumaan", "hundreds", "talks", "reading", "critic"]}
