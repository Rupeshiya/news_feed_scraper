{"authors": ["Rebecca Onion"], "body": "I went into labor on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, and my daughter, J., was born the day after, as women marched in numbers on the Capitol. She was a massive young lady, in the pink of health. Throughout her early childhood, I wondered many times whether her birthdate means she\u2019s cursed to live in the worst America yet. In 2020, I\u2019ve realized that whatever her timing might mean for her own quality of life, having a very young, very oblivious person to care for through these years of panic has been an absolute godsend for my own mental health.\n\nI\u2019m not alone in this feeling. Researchers at the University of Oregon who are studying the experiences of families with young children during the pandemic found that parents saw their kids as sources of emotional support\u2014their young kids, not their older ones, who might be serving as conversational partners or providing material aid in the form of babysitting or housework. I think this is because young kids are living in an alternate reality. Or, as anthropologist Robin Nelson tweeted recently about her own experience, \u201cYou can be fully and deeply saddened by the state of things & your toddler doesn\u2019t give AF \u2013 nor should they. And you have to rise to the challenge of keeping their life light & joyful & normal. She wants to give the dog a treat & play & avoid the bath \u2013 so we do.\u201d\n\nJ.\u2019s very young age helps, a lot. Young children, as Nelson points out, don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on outside of their small worlds, and (as she puts it) shouldn\u2019t be expected to care. And my guilt about what J. might be missing is minimal. Unlike older children, who have past Halloweens and Christmases and summers to remember, and are struggling with missing their friends and with the demands of online school, J. barely remembers what the Before Times were like. School is a dim memory; for the most part, a little bit of outdoor social interaction with pod friends seems to be plenty. To her, every time is Now Time.\n\nGetting into Now Time with J. means putting the digital world aside. A confluence of lucky factors in our pandemic lives means that I don\u2019t need to try to work when I\u2019m around J., and so can continue our \u201cno looking at the internet when the child\u2019s around\u201d policy. We instituted this when she was right around five months and started grabbing at our phones when they were out. At first, we thought this was a policy mostly for her, so that she wouldn\u2019t get too much screen exposure; but we\u2019ve also come to see that the abstracted, anxious state of mind you get in when you\u2019re on Twitter doesn\u2019t mix well with parenting. In 2020, this policy means that I must limit my doom-scrolling to work time. That\u2019s fine\u2014eight hours is probably plenty.\n\nThe circle of adults J. sees that aren\u2019t me\u2014my husband, a few friends, family over Facetime\u2014tries not to talk about stressful pandemic things when she\u2019s present. If she asks questions, we\u2019ll answer them. She\u2019s not completely oblivious\u2014kids are feelings sponges\u2014and she can definitely tell that \u201cthe germ\u201d is important to us. (I know she knows this, because she\u2019ll sometimes call me back into her room after we\u2019ve said goodnight and ask \u201cWhat does \u2018germ\u2019 mean?,\u201d hoping to trigger an involved conversation that\u2019ll stretch out her awake time.) But she doesn\u2019t have much capacity to pursue the topic. When I dole out very simple bits of information, watching in between to see if she\u2019s still following, she quickly gets bored and starts organizing her growing collection of Pez dispensers, turning her\u2014and my\u2014attention back to what\u2019s here and now.\n\nThe 3-year-old-ness of her fills up a room with ease, crowding everything else out. This is a quality of preschoolers that can be annoying if you\u2019re trying to be efficient, but if you want to be distracted, it\u2019s just what the doctor ordered. J.\u2019s capable of leaping with joy at the prospect of a train ride one minute, then collapsing into sadness when we won\u2019t let her scatter her basket of hats across the mudroom floor, the next. She works on her little stable of character imitations\u2014widening her eyes like Moana, putting a bow on top of her head like Sister Bear, or wearing goggles like Calvin when he\u2019s Spaceman Spiff. She is full of intense, rude, relentless requests\u2014\u201dGIMME WATER!\u201d \u201cToast wif\u2019 butter!\u201d \u201cCome see how cozy I look, under this blanket!\u201d Then, the next minute, she will say \u201cPlease,\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d and \u201cSorry,\u201d as nicely as the nicest adult.\n\nEven when we\u2019re not directly interacting, her little mind occupies the house, crowding out the darkness. She plays the drums, the tambourine, the recorder, the harmonica\u2014loudly. And her internal monologue is fully external. When she\u2019s tinkering with her dollhouse or stuffies, and I\u2019m doing some household task nearby, I don\u2019t feel the need to turn on a podcast, or even music. I let my mind float along with her prattle about mommies, daddies, babies, and birdies, doing my best imitation of a person who is capable of thinking about nothing\u2014just a mom, over here, getting these dishes done on a bright fall day.\n\nIn replies to tweets about parental burnout in 2020, you\u2019ll often find people voicing variations of this toxic sentiment: \u201cWhy have kids, if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them?\u201d I think something many non-parents are missing about parents\u2019 2020 sadness is that the pandemic, which has taken away so much, is also taking away our ability to compartmentalize. Pure Kid Time\u2014family time\u2014is a salve I\u2019d recommend to anyone, but the magic only works if the parent can be completely present. Want to help support parents\u2019 mental health?
