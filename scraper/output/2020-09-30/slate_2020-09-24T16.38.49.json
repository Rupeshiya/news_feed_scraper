{"authors": ["Nick Greene"], "body": "The Miami Heat are full of surprises. On any given night you can expect a different player to play savior. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals it was center Bam Adebayo, who infantilized the Boston Celtics\u2019 Jason Tatum with a game-saving block. The Heat turned a five-point deficit into a five-point margin of victory during the closing minutes of Game 2 thanks to Goran Dragic\u2019s offense and Jimmy Butler\u2019s defense. And when it came time to spin the bingo cage on Wednesday to see which letters would spell hero in Game 4, the results were almost literal: Rookie Tyler Herro scored 37 points off the bench, leading his team to a 112-109 victory and a 3-1 series edge.\n\nSportscasters tend to refer to confidence as a mysterious intangible that exists outside the empirical realm, but Herro\u2019s self-belief is as obvious as his jersey number. Rookies usually don\u2019t take huge shots at the end of crucial playoff games. When they do, it typically doesn\u2019t go well, even when they are Kobe Bryant. See the 1997 Western Conference semifinals for reference.\n\nBut when the 20-year-old Herro pulled up from long range on Wednesday, the entire world expected the ball to go in. And it did.\n\nTyler Herro with the deeeeep three \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/QAlYWejWAU \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 24, 2020\n\nWhen reporters told Butler after the game that Herro had credited him for his development, the Heat\u2019s veteran star demurred. \u201cHe\u2019s done this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just pump him with a lot of confidence, and I think he pumps himself with twice as much confidence.\u201d Herro\u2019s performances in the bubble shouldn\u2019t be a total shock. The 13th pick of the 2019 NBA Draft was hitting clutch shots all the way back when people were actually allowed to watch games in person.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say anyone expected him to join Magic Johnson and Derrick Rose as the only players under the age of 21 to score 30 points in an NBA playoff game. But Herro\u2019s performance in Game 4 didn\u2019t look aberrant or accidental. Herro may have a smooth outside shooting stroke, but he\u2019s just as comfortable cutting into the lane with or without the ball. Combine all that, and you can understand why he calls himself \u201ca bucket.\u201d (In case that\u2019s not totally clear \u2026 it\u2019s because he scores a lot of buckets.)\n\nHerro can't be stopped, he's up to 30 points! \ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/F2nPcvIhcx \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 24, 2020\n\nWay back in 2017 and 2018, when he was a Milwaukee high schooler, Herro\u2019s highlight tapes made him an internet folk hero. Those old highlight clips started popping up on Twitter while he was torching the Celtics on Wednesday, and they serve as evidence that his style has remained perfectly intact as he\u2019s transitioned from high school to college to the pros.\n\nHerro initially committed to the University of Wisconsin, which, ignoring geography, was an odd choice. The Badgers aren\u2019t exactly known for their stylistic verve, and for decades their squads have been composed entirely of sentient hay bales. Herro smartly decommitted from Wisconsin in favor of Kentucky in 2018. The switch made him a villain in his home state, but it prepared him to enter the NBA after just one college season, something he believes he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do as a Badger. (He also probably would have been banned from dribbling between his legs had he stayed in Wisconsin.)\n\nHerro seems like he\u2019d be easy to dislike, as he looks like a TikTok star who films himself pulling pranks in nursing homes. His youth alone should make him worthy of scorn.\n\nTyler Herro is the only player born in the 2000s to play in a conference finals \ud83d\ude33\n\n\n\n(via @ESPNStatsInfo) pic.twitter.com/kF2leRMmii \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 24, 2020\n\nBut then you watch him play, and you can\u2019t help but enjoy the Herro experience. He\u2019s just too damned good. He always knew this. Now the rest of the world knows it, too.\n\nListen to an episode of Slate\u2019s sports podcast Hang Up and Listen below, or subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:34.815086", "publish_date": "2020-09-24", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-24 16:38:49.299000+00:00", "publish_time": "16:38:49", "source": "slate", "title": "Tyler Herro Forces You to Believe in Tyler Herro Almost As Much As Tyler Herro Believes in Tyler Herro", "topics": ["herros", "play", "game", "nba", "espn", "forces", "believe", "points", "confidence", "conference", "hes", "believes", "herro", "tyler"]}
