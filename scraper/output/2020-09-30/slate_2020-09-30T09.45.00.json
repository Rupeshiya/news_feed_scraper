{"authors": ["Dan Kois"], "body": "When I asked my wife if she\u2019d like to watch the new Netflix documentary Dick Johnson Is Dead with me, she asked what it was about. As I explained it to her, I realized that the movie I was describing sounded a little bit disturbing. When I finished, my wife looked horrified and said, \u201cNo, no thanks.\u201d I\u2019m still working on her, but I\u2019m here to tell you that despite all this, the movie is amazing and you should absolutely watch it.\n\nIn Dick Johnson Is Dead, the documentary cameraperson (and director of Cameraperson) Kirsten Johnson is faced with her father\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. Nearly a decade before, her mother had died of the same disease, and the experience was excruciating: She felt she lost her mom, abandoned her, and had nothing left to remember her by. This time, she wants to handle things differently. She asks her father if he\u2019ll make a movie with her. In the movie, they\u2019ll talk about his upcoming death, but they\u2019ll also, puckishly, enact it\u2014using the magic of cinema to kill him off in a half-dozen staged accidents. They\u2019ll even send him up to heaven so he can see what it\u2019s like. In this way, daughter can capture her father before his decline; father can, in an odd way, face his own mortality; and father and daughter can have a project to work on together now that he\u2019s moving into her New York City apartment.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

(\u201cI\u2019m bleeding!\u201d Dick says as fake blood squirts out of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m bleeding to death.\u201d) We also see the business surrounding this odd family project: the prop guy and his styrofoam air conditioner, the makeup artist who teaches Dick how the blood pump will work, the soundwoman who doesn\u2019t like watching Dick fake his own death. \u201cThat really hurt!\u201d Dick says with delight, watching a stuntman taking a particularly nasty fall.\n\nThrough it all, Dick Johnson is sweet, funny, a little weird. He\u2019s clearly having a ball, helping his daughter in her work, participating in his own demise. In the movie\u2019s version of Heaven, his ailing body is cured, popcorn falls from the sky, and he is greeted by his wife, Bruce Lee, and Farrah Fawcett. On the Heaven soundstage, a crew member brings Dick a chair to sit and watch the proceedings; later we see him napping in that chair as the grips bustle around him. The more we watch Dick, the more we love him, seeing in him the kindness and curiosity that has made his daughter love him so much.\n\nWe know that this story must end with Dick Johnson\u2019s actual death. But I found that as I watched Dick Johnson Is Dead, I came to dread the immense sadness of his end\u2014of all of our ends\u2014much less. The result is a movie that\u2019s sad, but not at all unbearable\u2014in fact, that\u2019s oddly inspiring. What a gift Kirsten Johnson gave her father and herself. (And her kids, who helped brainstorm ways to kill off Grandpa.) Dick Johnson Is Dead is a testament to the power of talking forthrightly about death with those you love. It shows how death may never lose its power, exactly, but you can make yourselves partners in the process, not victims of it.\n\nAs I watched Dick Johnson Is Dead, I came to dread the immense sadness of his end\u2014of all of our ends\u2014much less.\n\nMy dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s a few years ago. We\u2019ve been lucky, comparatively, in that his memory loss has not proceeded as quickly as Dick Johnson\u2019s does. But I\u2019ve struggled to talk about the disease with him, and have barely broached the reality of his likely end. Dick Johnson Is Dead avoids, for the most part, the typical artistic clich\u00e9s of memory loss: There\u2019s no fading away, no disappearance. Instead, the movie makes clear that Dick Johnson with Alzheimer\u2019s is not some watered-down version of the man he used to be. He\u2019s a person, with his own quirks, his own creativity, and a kind and winning personality that if anything comes into sharper focus as his memory falters. (Late at night, he wakes his daughter up, convinced that there\u2019s a patient outside who needs his help.) The movie is as much his creation as his daughter\u2019s, a testament to the power of what the MacArthur-winning gerontologist Anne Basting\u2014who devises theater in nursing homes with dementia patients\u2014calls \u201ccreative care.\u201d\n\nPerhaps when I have lost my own father as my wife has hers, I\u2019ll regard a project like Dick Johnson Is Dead with as much apprehension as she did. Perhaps there\u2019s something about my geographic distance from him that creates dispassion akin to the documentarian\u2019s camera, that allows me to see this film\u2019s conceit as fascinating but not upsetting. I don\u2019t know. But I watched the movie with mounting delight, thrilled for Kirsten and Dick that in their final years together they have been able to make something splendid and surprising, something that reflects their shared interests, their shared genius, and their shared love. Though Kirsten Johnson never loses her precise cameraperson\u2019s eye, there\u2019s nothing unfeeling about Dick Johnson Is Dead. I hope I can find a way to talk with my father as frankly as Kirsten talks to Dick. And I hope that when I\u2019m on my way out, my daughters take me as seriously, and treat me as kindly, as this beautiful movie does its hero.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:29.067060", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 09:45:00+00:00", "publish_time": "09:45:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Dick Johnson Is Dead review: One woman\u2019s oddly inspiring documentary about killing her dad.", "topics": ["movie", "dead", "father", "im", "daughter", "wife", "womans", "dick", "death", "oddly", "kirsten", "inspiring", "review", "documentary", "johnson", "killing", "dad"]}
