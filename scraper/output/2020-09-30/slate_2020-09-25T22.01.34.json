The song, called \u201cMake Me an Offer I Cannot Refuse,\u201d is explicitly a prayer (\u201cLord, I need deliverance\u201d) that also sets the emotional tone for a protracted 80-minute voyage through desperation, rage, pleasure, and transcendence\u2014though not in any such neat, cathartic order.\n\nThat early disavowal of na\u00efvet\u00e9 stood out for me on a record the now\u201345-year-old longtime indie-or-what-have-you darling has said that for him is unprecedently \u201cpolitical and bossy and bitchy.\u201d I wondered whether he\u2019d at all call to account his white, Christian self amid the havoc being wreaked disproportionately by putatively Christian white Americans. He\u2019s right that this is no moment for pretensions to blamelessness. And I was especially alert to that hazard because earlier in Stevens\u2019 career, his apparent cultivation of an aura of guileless purity was what made me wary of him.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, onstage and on albums such as Michigan and Illinois (which launched a PR-stunt conceit about making albums for all 50 states that many fans took all too seriously), Stevens tended to come off like a liberal Christian youth group leader cajoling listeners alternately to get in touch with their feelings and to sing along with show tunes. With songs like 2005\u2019s \u201cChicago,\u201d I could never deny his musical gifts, but I also couldn\u2019t stop eye-rolling at his penchant for tour outfits like multicolored angel wings. When he later told Pitchfork that \u201csome of my most profound spiritual and sexual experiences were at a Methodist summer camp,\u201d it was the least surprising interview revelation ever\u2014except for the part where he said \u201csexual.\u201d To my ears, most of Stevens\u2019 music seemed averse to incorporating the messy physical aspects of human experience, maybe due to his faith\u2019s long history of setting the spirit at war with the flesh, or perhaps because it would clash with the mood of whimsical childishness at which so much of his work seemed to aim. Even when he sang about serial killer John Wayne Gacy, it was hard to take seriously because it was couched in the social-studies-class-friendly context of the imaginary \u201cstates project,\u201d reducing the subject to just another curious fact about Illinois, like UFO sightings and the Sears Tower, but with added mischievous shock factor. And when he wasn\u2019t staging happy-clappy revues, he was playing tremulous, reverent acoustic music, as on the Seven Swans album, whose vulnerabilities still felt studied and removed.\n\nNone of that might have counted against Stevens so much if it hadn\u2019t been part of a pernicious tendency of the period. This gauzy idealization of childishness seemed endemic to indie rock of the time (think of early Bright Eyes and Arcade Fire, for instance), particularly among artists often grouped with Stevens as psychedelic folk or \u201cfreak folk,\u201d such as Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and Animal Collective. Individually I admired many (not all) of these artists, but collectively they seemed to be staging a kind of privileged retreat from the dystopic realities of post-9/11 America while claiming it as resistance. It recollected the worst solipsistic flower-child affectations of 1960s hippies and flattered and indulged their audiences\u2019 insular LiveJournaling sensitivities. In Stevens\u2019 case, that was enhanced by the traces of Jesus People religiosity. My reaction to his faith was admittedly too knee-jerk, but I was particularly put off by his connection with the Danielson Famile, a group that blended elements lifted from so-called outsider music (such as Daniel Johnston) with folk-mass-style sounds and theatrical costumes. It read at first like kitschy performance art, then more and more like evangelism under hipster cover\u2014a 2000s sequel to the convert-seeking 1970s day-glo children\u2019s music of the Jesus Movement.\n\nEventually these stances had much of their viability knocked out by the trinity of the Obama election, the 2008 recession, and the subsequent Occupy movement, not to mention how the rest of the music landscape was shifting in turn. Stevens\u2019 response was to lay down his banjo and make 2010\u2019s The Age of Adz, a noisy electronic album that at the time struck me as an awkward effort to catch up to indie\u2019s growing awareness of pop, with clumsy beats and a strained tone I traced to his reflexive disdain for the worldliness of mass culture. (There\u2019s still some of that on The Ascension, as I\u2019ll get to momentarily.)\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

Because what came next (aside from his frequent instrumental and novelty side projects, such as 2012\u2019s Christmas song collection Silver & Gold) was a record that confronted the woundedness so much of his work had seemed to acknowledge only in its suppression. It was also one that perhaps explained and exorcised the earlier specter of arrested development. And speaking of conversions, in terms of Sufjan Stevens fandom, it was mine.\n\nCarrie & Lowell, released in 2015, was a raw, close-up memoir of Stevens\u2019 difficult, scattered childhood, with (but mostly without) a mother with severe mental health issues, written and recorded in the wake of her death. It\u2019s no doubt unoriginal of me to pair it with the Mountain Goats\u2019 2005 tour de force, The Sunset Tree, about John Darnielle\u2019s youth under the roof of an abusive stepfather (and likewise made after his death), but it does have a comparable force, and it drew similar acclaim. Yet in Stevens\u2019 story, the stepfather, Lowell Brams, is unusually enough its hero, a mentor who, when he could, fostered Stevens\u2019 nascent artistry and would later even go on to partner with Stevens in founding his Asthmatic Kitty music label. (The two also co-created a quasi\u2013New Age instrumental album, Aporia, earlier this year.)\n\nCarrie & Lowell also illuminated Stevens\u2019 attachments to the leftovers of \u201960s counterculture, coming from hippie parents prey to the excesses and estrangements of the time. That included his biological father\u2019s involvement in alternative religion, if you couldn\u2019t guess from Stevens\u2019 Eastern mysticism\u2013appropriating given name and his inherited spiritual questing. If his early records echoed folkie preciousness and Summer of Love exuberance, and Age of Adz was kind of a jumbled prog rock\u2013ish stab at significance, then Carrie & Lowell was his early-1970s-style singer-songwriter confessional, \u00e0 la Joni Mitchell on Blue or Bob Dylan on Blood on the Tracks.\n\nIn that shadow timeline, I\u2019m tempted to propose that The Ascension would be Stevens\u2019 equivalent of mid-to-late-1970s post-Watergate records of malaise and disillusion, such as Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson\u2019s Winter in America, Mitchell\u2019s The Hissing of Summer Lawns, Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Darkness on the Edge of Town, and anything by Warren Zevon or Randy Newman or Steely Dan; you could put early CBGB punk in there too. The Ascension certainly shares their atmospheres of lost hopes and a nation in shambles. But the comparisons won\u2019t stand, not just because the album is not up to that high level, but more positively because one of the apparent effects of Stevens having reckoned with his past is that he\u2019s been able to wake up fully into the present. It\u2019s a rude awakening, of course, given what that moment looks like, but what Stevens has made from it is no throwback. It\u2019s a mature reflection on personal and social crises and how they intersect, assembled in equal parts from current sounds and from his own idiosyncratic lexicon.\n\nNo doubt to some fans\u2019 dismay, the album finds Stevens reconciling with pop, complete with songs that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on a 2020 \u201cchill beats\u201d or \u201csad dance\u201d Spotify playlist. Stevens told Vanity Fair this week that one of his inspirations was Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cThank U, Next,\u201d for its \u201cso over it\u201d self-possession. But elsewhere, he evokes 1980s and 1990s electronic music, from Depeche Mode on \u201cVideo Game,\u201d to Nine Inch Nails on the more gnarled \u201cAtivan\u201d and \u201cGilgamesh,\u201d to the Pet Shop Boys on perhaps my favorite track, \u201cGoodbye to All That.\u201d\n\nOne of the apparent effects of Stevens having reckoned with his past is that he\u2019s been able to wake up fully into the present.\n\nThat song references Joan Didion\u2019s famous 1967 essay that became the template for every \u201cleaving New York\u201d narrative to come\u2014and thus nods to Stevens\u2019 own recent departure from the city for the Catskills. This came a couple of years after his rental-market eviction from his long-standing Brooklyn studio and office, which required him to craft more music in his apartment. Apart from his obvious desire to make a sonic turnabout from Carrie & Lowell, that change of environment is part of why the bulk of the music on The Ascension was made by Stevens solo on synthesizers, drum machines, and his own impressively varied multitracked vocals. (Multi-instrumentalist Casey Foubert joins him on most of the songs, supplemented by guest spots from the arresting drummer James McAlister, the National guitarist Bryce Dessner, and underground Norwegian studio icon Emil Nikolaisen, who\u2019s credited for playing what\u2019s only described as \u201cblack magic.\u201d) Stevens\u2019 main tool is an array of Prophet polyphonic synthesizers\u2014maybe he just couldn\u2019t resist the scriptural overtones of the brand name, but their sound is heavily associated with 1980s pop as well. Still, \u201cGoodbye to All That\u201d includes lines that reinforce Stevens\u2019 need to detach himself from nostalgia addiction, stating wryly: \u201cNow that all of my dreams have been confiscated/ Circa 1975/ Now that it\u2019s too late to have died a young man/ Well, I\u2019m just glad that I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\n\nThe Ascension is also at times a sensuous, romantic album\u2014even if the romance is ever in peril\u2014that reminded me of recent alternative or bedroom pop (i.e., unpopular pop) by artists such as Perfume Genius, Christine and the Queens, Sophie, King Princess, Solange, and others who work the borderlands between introspection and danceability. Like 1980s synth-pop, that space is often a queer one, whether by artist declaration or audience affiliation, and in recent years, many fans have claimed Stevens for the queer canon in site comments and Reddit threads and the likes of the Facebook group \u201cIs this Sufjan Stevens song gay or just about God?\u201d His 2018 Oscar nomination for writing songs for Call Me by Your Name boosted that association, and in 2019 he seemed to endorse the assumption quietly by releasing a pair of songs for Pride Month, along with a rainbow-motif T-shirt and a blog post about self-love and shame that quoted RuPaul and Jesus in the same breath. I\u2019ve been left pondering how I for so long overlooked the possibility that the evasions as well as some of the stylistic flourishes that troubled me with Stevens may have been marks of a young Christian guy struggling with a taboo identity, although he still frustrates some LGBTQ+ fans by declining to address his sexuality directly.\n\nLikewise, there might be confusion among some listeners who\u2019ve been primed for a \u201cpolitical\u201d album by Stevens\u2019 recent interviews and by the first single released in July, the album\u2019s 12-minute closing jeremiad-of-sorts, \u201cAmerica.\u201d For a supposed \u201cprotest\u201d song, even that\u2019s a pretty weird one. Yes, early on it seems to announce the singer falling out of love with the country and to perhaps nod to the wide-eyed-simpleton pose of his \u201c50 states\u201d period patriotism with the line \u201cI have traded my life/ For a picture of the scenery.\u201d But from first hearing its key repeated line, \u201cDon\u2019t do to me what you did to America,\u201d what struck me was the mysteriousness of the \u201cyou\u201d being addressed here. It doesn\u2019t parse well as Donald Trump or some other authority figure, especially considering that Stevens has said the song was originally drafted years before Trump\u2019s election and the fact that after the first verse almost all the language is steeped in the sacred. \u201cI have worshipped, I have cried/ I have put my hands in the wounds on your side,\u201d Stevens sings, going on to call himself \u201ca Judas in heat.\u201d I\u2019m inclined to imagine Stevens is addressing his fellow American Christians here, not disavowing his faith but severing himself from its corrupted institutional forms, along the pattern of his excoriating 2017 Washington Post op-ed that called it \u201cheresy\u201d to co-opt Christ to a nationalist cause. This is political, yes, but like Stevens\u2019 approach to his sexuality, it\u2019s not a form that adapts easily to the standard 2020 definition, easily interpreted through scrims of ready-made identities and trending catchwords and reference points. Not that such rallying cries can\u2019t be artistically potent too, but Stevens is daring here not to preach to any preassembled choir, to portray himself in the throes of doubt (even utter nihilistic misanthropy in the sour, tedious \u201cDeath Star\u201d), and challenge the listener to discover him there.\n\nThroughout the record, there\u2019s no escaping the way it\u2019s haunted by God. Sometimes it\u2019s in the long tradition across many cultures (not to mention generations of not-so-straight pastors and choir leaders) of weaving the erotic with the spiritually ecstatic, the heavenly savior with the earthly beloved. Hear, for example, how the romantic \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d (which would have fit well into the Call Me by Your Name soundtrack) is echoed and answered in the more divinely directed \u201cUrsa Major\u201d refrain \u201cI want to love you,\u201d with the implied caveat that God doesn\u2019t always make it easy. Occasionally it\u2019s self-righteous, as on the \u201ckids these days\u201d\u2013ish anti-technology single \u201cVideo Game.\u201d But then a song will come along that questions what claim Stevens has to righteousness. At its peaks, for example on the song \u201cLandslide,\u201d there\u2019s a running tension between the search for personal connection and the terror and beauty of the sublime. Plus, Stevens\u2019 newfound appreciation for pop (complete with song titles that are allusions to other song titles, like \u201cRun Away With Me,\u201d \u201cVideo Game,\u201d and \u201cLandslide\u201d itself) has clued him in to the benefits of using everyday language, repetition, and even clich\u00e9\u2014which helps puts a check on his past weakness for overwritten lyrics.\n\nThe unfortunate exception to me is in the title track, \u201cThe Ascension,\u201d perhaps the record\u2019s most direct and \u201cOld Sufjan\u201d\u2013style song, which seems to try to turn the record\u2019s conflicted subtexts into expository text and, on my few listens so far, comes up with a garbled mess. By contrast, the single-line \u201cDie Happy\u201d evokes perfectly the record\u2019s running negotiation of the balance between personal fulfillment and social or existential disaster. Stevens liltingly reiterates the mantra \u201cI wanna die happy\u201d over chiming keyboards increasingly menaced by metallic chirps and flanges and stings. This basic yearning stands alone against a grander backdrop that becomes more and more overwhelming as the song continues\u2014until it flares out into a dance party.\n\nHow many listeners will find their way to those moments on The Ascension is another question, amid all its sprawling loops and textures in an hour and 20 minutes. I expect that I\u2019ll eventually trim quite a few tracks from future listens. On the other hand, I will add the \u201cAmerica\u201d B-side \u201cMy Rajneesh,\u201d which didn\u2019t make the album but is a gorgeous and initially deceptive adaptation of the same true cult story told in Netflix\u2019s popular Wild Wild Country but with a deeper, subtler sympathy for the devotees led astray. Meanwhile, if Stevens loses some of his own devotees here in his pursuit of the urgent complexity of the moment, he could always dust off the banjos and ukuleles for his own back-to-the-land album, made in his new Catskills homestead. And I\u2019ll be ready to hear it, as long as, by then, there\u2019s any land left to get back to.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:34.134568", "publish_date": "2020-09-25", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-25 22:01:34.227000+00:00", "publish_time": "22:01:34", "source": "slate", "title": "The Ascension review: Sufjan Stevens\u2019 new album is no protest record.", "topics": ["lowell", "protest", "sufjan", "record", "songs", "song", "pop", "music", "early", "review", "stevens", "album", "records", "ascension"]}
