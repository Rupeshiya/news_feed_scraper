{"authors": ["Adam Chodorow"], "body": "The explosive New York Times report on Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns confirms a great number of things about the president\u2019s finances we\u2019ve only been able to speculate about for years. We now know that Trump really was telling the truth when he claimed, beginning in the 2016 presidential campaign, that he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (though such an audit would not prevent him from releasing his returns\u2014that part he really did make up). We also now know\u2014though we basically already did\u2014that while Trump made a lot of money from The Apprentice, he really does love debt, and most of the businesses he\u2019s actually run have lost a lot of money. All told, Trump has personally guaranteed about $421 million in debt, most of which will come due within the next four years.\n\nThe returns that the Times describes, stretching from 2000\u201317, raise a host of issues you would generally not want a president to have: There are foreign payments to Trump businesses (a possible influence on foreign policy), apparent fibbing about property valuations (Trump allegedly inflated the value of property he owned so that he could overstate the value of an environmental easement he claimed as a charitable deduction), and payments to his daughter as a consultant (even though he also employed her as a senior executive at his real estate company). One of the most stunning revelations\u2014beyond the headline figure that Trump paid only $750 in taxes in 2016 and again in 2017\u2014is of Trump\u2019s attempt to get a refund from the IRS for $72 million in 2010 by claiming $1.4 billion in losses in 2008 and 2009, which would not only justify the refund but also wipe out any income tax he would owe for years to come. This request apparently triggered the audit we\u2019ve heard so much about.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Trump pulled such a move. We learned from tax returns leaked in the runup to the 2016 election that Donald Trump claimed a $915.7 million loss in 1995, which he used to avoid paying taxes for about 10 years. Add the $1.4 billion from the Times\u2019 new reporting and you\u2019ve got well over $2 billion in losses, quite impressive for a man who bills himself as a savvy businessman with an almost preternatural ability to spot and make deals.\n\nThe earlier loss was related to his failed casino business: Trump borrowed about $1 billion and lost it. If Trump had defaulted on the debt and it had been forgiven, he would have had to pay tax on the canceled debt. Otherwise, both Trump and the bank could claim a loss on the loans. However, the banks swapped this debt for equity in the failing business. By all rights, this swap should have resulted in canceled debt income to Trump\u2014and a tax bill\u2014because the equity was worth significantly less than the debt owed. Somehow that got lost in the shuffle. The result was that Trump got to earn about $1 billion of income going forward and pay no tax on it until 2005.\n\nIf Trump prevails in claiming this second massive loss, he will have succeeded in paying almost nothing in income taxes on more than $2 billion of income.\n\nBack to the new documents: About $700 million of the most recent loss also appears to be casino-related (the rest appear to be from operating losses suffered by Trump\u2019s businesses). According to the Times, Trump claimed to have abandoned a partnership interest in that same floundering casino business, generating the loss. However, he may have received an equity interest in the reorganized casino entity, which undermines his claim of \u201cabandonment\u201d and should have prevented him from taking the loss.\n\nWe have no way of knowing whether the IRS audited Trump back in the 1990s, when he claimed the first loss. Given the IRS\u2019s limited resources, things do slip by. This time, however, he couldn\u2019t escape IRS scrutiny. It\u2019s one thing to avoid taxes you should pay by understating your income or claiming a loss that can be carried forward. It is quite another to ask the government to send you a check for $72 million.\n\nGiven the possibility of fraud (indeed, there is a cottage industry among some inmates of filing false refund claims so they can bilk the government), Congress wisely requires that all large tax refund requests be reviewed and approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a technocratic, nonpartisan organization that supports both the House and Senate when it comes to tax matters. And that is where this story gets interesting.\n\nTrump\u2019s refund claim well exceeded the $2 million threshold for JCT review, and the fact that we\u2019re talking about it now suggests officials had some questions. The New York Times reports that there was a possible settlement in 2014 but that it never happened, and that the committee\u2019s review expanded to include subsequent years, where any unused losses would apply to reduce future income taxes.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know, including what caused the JCT to reject the refund claim, the amount of any proposed settlement in 2014, why the settlement faltered, and why the dispute has not yet been resolved. We also don\u2019t know whether the more recent loss was a real loss of Trump\u2019s money or again reflected money he had borrowed and lost. The one thing we do know is that, while Trump may have made a lot of money selling his name and as a reality television star, he has lost money in just about every business venture he has been actively involved with.\n\nThe national average for tax refunds is about $3,000, typically due because employers overwithhold federal income taxes. Trump\u2019s request for $72 million is a few standard deviations above the mean. Contrary to some speculation, Trump\u2019s returns and the refund request makes clear that he has actually made a significant amount of money over the years and he has actually paid some tax on that income (though not a lot relative to the income he\u2019s earned). If he prevails in claiming this second massive loss, he will have succeeded in paying almost nothing in income taxes on more than $2 billion of income.\n\nNo one is obligated to pay more in taxes than is actually owed. However, there is a difference between good tax planning and tax evasion. It looks like we will need to wait for the resolution of Trump\u2019s refund request and accompanying audit to see what the government ultimately concludes about the merits. Either way, Trump reportedly paid $750 in income taxes over the past two years for which we have data\u2014and tried to pay nothing for many years before that. I wonder how that will play with his base voters, many of whom earn far less yet pay so much more. With an election he\u2019s losing entering its final stretch, the audit still outstanding, and more than $400 million in personally guaranteed debt coming due, it may finally be time for Trump to pay up.\n\nFor more of Slate\u2019s news coverage, subscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts or listen below.", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:25.245102", "publish_date": "2020-09-28", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-28 15:16:00.331000+00:00", "publish_time": "15:16:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Trump's taxes: the most brazen trick he tried to pull on the IRS.", "topics": ["tried", "taxes", "trump", "tax", "irs", "refund", "trick", "income", "brazen", "pay", "trumps", "debt", "loss", "pull", "money"]}
