{"authors": ["Rachelle Hampton"], "body": "After a brief hiatus (and an Emmy win), John Oliver returned to Last Week Tonight on Sunday with a less-than-uplifting take on Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s likely confirmation to the Supreme Court: \u201cIf things seem hopeless right now, its because, to be honest, they basically are.\u201d\n\nOliver reflected on the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the cravenness of the Republican rush to fill her open seat less than two months before the presidential election, spending the majority of the segment examining Mitch McConnell\u2019s agenda to pack the courts with conservative judges. He also explained how we got to a place where Republicans can say they represent the will of the people while leaving aside the electorate\u2019s opposition to their party platform.\n\nTed Cruz accurately summed up the party\u2019s inaccurate line, saying that the \u201cAmerican people elected President Trump and a Republican majority because we want the Constitution and Bill of Rights protected and that is our job and what we need to do.\u201d For him, Oliver composed a little poem:\n\nI do not like that man, Ted Cruz I do not like his backwoods views I do not like his stupid suits I do not like his cowboy boots I do not like him when he sneezes I do not like him eating cheeses I hate to see his dumb face smirking Because his beard looks like a merkin.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

But the next battle has to start right now.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-30 18:58:33.712643", "publish_date": "2020-09-28", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-28 18:05:33.300000+00:00", "publish_time": "18:05:33", "source": "slate", "title": "John Oliver Says the Supreme Court Fight Is Already Lost\u2014but Others Are Just Beginning", "topics": ["slate", "john", "senate", "supreme", "majority", "fight", "right", "american", "court", "lostbut", "signing", "beginning", "week", "republican", "oliver"]}
