{"authors": ["Justin Peters"], "body": "The first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden did not get good reviews. ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos called it the worst debate he\u2019d ever seen. Others openly questioned whether we should bother having any more debates this cycle, given how bad this one was. \u201cThe American people lost. That was horrific,\u201d Jake Tapper said on CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re on cable, so I can say this: That was a shitshow,\u201d agreed Dana Bash.\n\nDana Bash really summed that one riiiiiiight up pic.twitter.com/QrCn7ADsH1 \u2014 Jilly (@jilldubs) September 30, 2020\n\nA shitshow it certainly was! The first presidential debate of the 2020 general election was an exhausting and dispiriting affair. For 90 minutes, Trump kept on interrupting and belittling Biden and moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. When he wasn\u2019t heckling the other two men onstage, he was working hard to lock up the ignorant-maniac vote. He refused to condemn white supremacy. He spouted discredited conspiracy theories. He took credit for things he didn\u2019t do and lied about things he did. He literally encouraged his supporters to go to the polls to keep tabs on election fraud. The president conclusively exposed who he really is to a national audience\u2014and while I get why one might not want to witness two more of these, that\u2019s why this one was a good debate.\n\nFor almost four years, Donald Trump has successfully avoided dissenting opinion, admitting little outside light into his cloister of morons. He has met the media on his own terms, in venues where he filibusters over hard questions and elicits softballs from friendly reporters. He has cultivated the credulous lickspittles of Fox News\u2019 opinion division and used them as conduits for his inaccurate, self-serving messages. But since becoming president, he has not once been challenged for an extended period by a hostile opponent and a competent moderator. And in the face of both of those things, he melted down.\n\nModerator Chris Wallace did superhuman work trying to keep Trump on task and honest. Though he didn\u2019t succeed at either of those things, he never stopped trying, and for that, he deserves applause and sympathy. At one point, he all but threw up his hands and yelled at Trump for not respecting the ground rules of the debate:\n\nWallace (to Trump): I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I\u2019m appealing to you, sir, to do that. Trump: And him, too. Wallace: Well, frankly, you\u2019ve been doing more interrupting than he has. Trump: That\u2019s all right. But he does plenty. Wallace: No, less than you have.\n\nTrump\u2019s loopiest supporters will cite this exchange as evidence that Wallace was in the tank for Biden. Everyone else who watched it will remember it as evidence that Trump is a real jerk.\n\nI confess that I wasn\u2019t expecting much from Wallace\u2014whose work I generally respect and admire\u2014as we went into the debate. On Tuesday afternoon, I rewatched the debate he moderated in 2016, between Trump and Hillary Clinton. He didn\u2019t do a great job. Though he was ready with pointed questions for both Trump and Clinton, he was consistently sidetracked by the unruly Trump, who spent the entire debate steamrolling both Wallace and Clinton\u2014and Wallace let him do it.\n\nThe Fox News Sunday host came better prepared for Trump\u2019s tactics this year. Before the debate, Wallace had said that he didn\u2019t see it as his job to be a fact-checker. And he didn\u2019t do much fact-checking in the \u201cwell, actually\u201d sense. Instead, Wallace put the fact checks in the premises of his questions. \u201cYou have not come up with a comprehensive plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump health care plan?\u201d Wallace asked early. \u201cYou have repeatedly contradicted and been at odds with some of your top scientists in your own government,\u201d he said during the COVID-19 section of the debate. \u201cWhat is radical about racial-sensitivity training, sir?\u201d Wallace asked at one point after Trump went off on a rant on that topic.\n\nWallace wasn\u2019t always able to pin Trump down, but he kept trying. \u201cSir, I\u2019m asking you a specific question. No, Mr. President, I\u2019m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income tax in 2016 and 2017?\u201d he pressed at one point. (\u201cMillions of dollars,\u201d Trump insisted, contradicting the New York Times\u2019 reporting that it was just $750.) Later, Wallace countered Trump\u2019s insistence that this summer\u2019s rising crime rates are exclusive to Democratic-run cities by noting that \u201cthere have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa. Is this actually a partisan issue?\u201d In these moments, with these sorts of questions and observations, Wallace offered clarity and necessary context to viewers.\n\nTrump\u2019s inability to offer coherent answers to these simple questions was evident, and to me, at least, it effectively showcased the extent to which Trump has absolutely nothing substantive to say. He covers his shallowness with jeers and bombast, and usually he is able to get away with it, often because the people with whom he\u2019s speaking ultimately decide that pushing back isn\u2019t worth the hassle. But both Wallace and Biden pushed back, and kept pushing back, and the back-and-forth said something meaningful about the choice voters are facing in November. Sure, it was a nightmare to watch, but it still said something indelible about who the president actually is.\n\nBut I already knew who the president was, you say? Well, this debate wasn\u2019t for you. This debate was for the 17 people who went into it unsure about these Trump and Biden fellows\u2014about who they are and what they stand for. Tuesday night certainly clarified that question, and it also laid bare the choice that these voters are facing in November. On one hand, you\u2019ve got chaos, cynicism, and calumny. On the other hand, you\u2019ve got Joe Biden, who sometimes stutters. The difference is clear now. Every swing voter can see it.\n\nMost presidential debates are horrible. It\u2019s in their DNA. The rapid-fire format is more like a game show than anything else, and candidates are apt to revert to stump speeches and canned applause lines. That happened on Tuesday night, too, but in a way that was revealing instead of obfuscatory.
