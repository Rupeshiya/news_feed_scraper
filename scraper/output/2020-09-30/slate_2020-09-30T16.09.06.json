{"authors": ["Lili Loofbourow"], "body": "This must be said first: Last night\u2019s debate was an offensive attack on the American people and on all this country aims to represent. Rather than disavow white supremacists when asked directly, the president issued them specific orders: \u201cStand back and stand by,\u201d he said. It\u2019s no surprise that the Proud Boys are celebrating what they saw as the president\u2019s acknowledgment that he is their leader and incorporated his words into their logo. Later, he encouraged his supporters to swarm the polls on Election Day to \u201cwatch carefully\u201d\u2014effectively calling for voter intimidation across the country. By the end of the night, he was shouting that the United States\u2014the country he serves and leads\u2014is all but incapable of holding legitimate elections. This was jaw-dropping, but Trump\u2019s egregious conduct was also familiar in the most literal sense of the term. When Trump gabbled about ballots in various waterways, belittled Joe Biden\u2019s university, and interrupted Biden\u2019s heartfelt recollection of his dead son to sneer that he didn\u2019t know him, what he evoked most clearly was a particular kind of male relation at the dinner table who won\u2019t shut up\u2014the abusive father or problematic uncle whose captive audience has learned to placate and mock and appease while he cruelly lashes out.\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.

In vain did moderator Chris Wallace remind Donald Trump that his campaign had agreed to this specific debate format; the impeached president, manifestly unaccustomed to being directly confronted or even challenged, talked and yelled and talked some more, expecting to prevail. It is to both Wallace\u2019s and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s credit that they talked over him in turn, refusing\u2014as much as any person could\u2014to let him simply bellow his way into more airtime. To do otherwise was not an option; it would have meant ceding Trump ground he can no longer be permitted to occupy. When a bully yells, you must yell back. But the overall effect was horrific. Chris Wallace got drawn into the abusive uncle dynamic: In his efforts to get the shouting president to wait his turn, he frequently opted for a kind of desperate appeasement, repeatedly assuring him\u2014as if the man were a toddler or a king\u2014that he \u201cwould like the next question.\u201d The dynamic was appalling but clear. Most of us have at one point or another shared a table with a man who had to be so \u201cmanaged.\u201d\n\nThe abusive parent lies because he can. He does as he likes, recognizing no authority above his own. He refuses to be held to any standard, swaps principles depending on how he feels but enforces his new convictions stringently on all his underlings. He is never responsible for what he says, but happily punishes and humiliates those around him for the slightest misstep. He can make promises one day and break them the next, all while feeling terrific about himself; his word means nothing, but his credit is endless. He carves out exception after exception.\n\nTrump finds the very idea of equality humiliating. He can only abide supremacy.\n\nIt is a terrible thing to be in thrall to such a person and to watch the world fail to stop him. Normally, however, this condition occurs in childhood (or in the context of an abusive marriage). That this roughly describes the present circumstances of many American adults is partly why so many people watching the debates felt such dread before it started, and such horror as it unfolded exactly as expected (maybe worse than expected). Nothing is more soul-crushing than watching an abusive father at work, because there appear to be no limits. And Trump is mean\u2014mean in his bones. He tries to charm at his rallies, but his real nature slipped through last night, when he was faced with an opponent he literally got himself impeached trying to avoid. And he couldn\u2019t forgive that, not even for a second. \u201cMy son was in Iraq, he spent a year there. He got the Bronze Star, he got the Conspicuous Service Medal,\u201d Biden said of Beau Biden, his son who died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden was bringing up Beau as a counter to Trump\u2019s demeaning comments about veterans. \u201cHe was not a loser,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe was a patriot, and the people left behind there were heroes.\u201d Trump interrupted to say, \u201cAre you talking about Hunter?\u201d attempting to resurrect the story that got him impeached. \u201cI\u2019m talking about my son Beau,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t know Beau, I know Hunter,\u201d Trump said, his lip curled with inhuman satisfaction.\n\nBiden was sincere, and his fatherly love for both his sons shone through. In a remarkable moment, Biden\u2014in a perfect antithesis to the abusive father figure\u2014stopped avoiding Trump\u2019s attacks on Hunter and paused to address an aspect of it, defending his child. He acknowledged that his son once had a drug problem, and that he\u2019d overcome it, and he was proud of him. This is a circumstance many Americans know well; the opioid crisis has made this problem familiar to many, many families. Trump used that pain to try to score a cheap point he\u2019d already tried to make a dozen times.\n\nThe defining quality of the abusive father is the abuse. Like most such men, Trump finds the very idea of equality humiliating. He can only abide supremacy. And he makes it clear that if he doesn\u2019t get his way, he will hurt you\u2014however he can, using whomever he can. Nazis, Proud Boys\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. As long as they\u2019re on his side, he\u2019ll use them against you. And if he doesn\u2019t get to win, he\u2019ll burn it all down with him.\n\nThose who have had an abusive relative know that what one longs for\u2014what one wants to have happen more than anything in the world\u2014is for someone in the outside world to acknowledge what\u2019s happening. To see it, and to stop it. Biden\u2019s performance was uneven, but he delivered on that in spades. He narrated what Trump was doing while looking at the camera and talking to the American people. He turned to him and said what so many Americans have desperately wished they could say: \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d It was cathartic, even validating.\n\nAmerica is not a family, though, and citizens are not children. When Biden delivered his last answer of the night, on election security, he was very clear about who has to do the rescuing. \u201cHe cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election,\u201d he said, countering Trump\u2019s numerous attempts to do exactly that. \u201cJust make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-30 23:09:51.760718", "publish_date": "2020-09-30", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-30 16:09:06.020000+00:00", "publish_time": "16:09:06", "source": "slate", "title": "Donald Trump is America\u2019s abusive father.", "topics": ["donald", "son", "president", "bidens", "americas", "trump", "know", "trumps", "abusive", "father", "country", "biden"]}
