National Guard Maj. Adam DeMarco told lawmakers that the Department of Defense\u2019s top military police officer sent an email June 1 asking the D.C. National Guard whether it had a weapon called an Active Denial System or ADS. The ADS, which was designed by the military two decades ago, is a weapon that operates much likes a microwave, and makes its targets feel as if their skin is burning. DeMarco was included on the email as the ranking D.C. National Guard officer that day.\n\nThe ADS was part of a larger buildup of weapons, lethal and nonlethal, that could be deployed against protesters. \u201cThe ADS can immediately compel an individual to cease threatening behavior or depart through application of a directed energy beam that provides a sensation of intense heat on the surface of the skin,\u201d the military police officer said in the email. \u201cThe effect is overwhelming, causing an immediate repel response by the targeted individual.\u201d The weapon had previously been considered unsuitable even for wartime deployment, but the officer said it \u201ccan provide our troops a capacity they currently do not have, the ability to reach out and engage potential adversaries at distances well beyond small arms range, and in a safe, effective, and nonlethal manner.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.

In late 2018, the New York Times reported, the Trump administration had weighed using the device on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014an idea shot down by Kirstjen Nielsen, then the Homeland Security secretary, citing humanitarian concerns.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:11.347334", "publish_date": "2020-09-17", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-17 10:22:15.471000+00:00", "publish_time": "10:22:15", "source": "slate", "title": "Military Police Sought \u201cHeat Ray\u201d Weapon Deemed Unsuitable for War to Use on D.C.
