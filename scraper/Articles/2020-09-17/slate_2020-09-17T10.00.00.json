That\u2019s right, we did it, folks: We wrapped up Thirst Aid Kit as a weekly podcast. We thank you for your ears, your enthusiasm, your tweets, your drabbles, your Tumblr Asks, your marriage proposals (1) and your gifs. This final episode is a song of gratitude and pride. Two Black women talking about female desire, race, and culture week in, week out? Yeah, we did THAT. What a glorious few years.\n\nBut please, do not despair. This is just a perfect example of one door closing in a mansion full of other doors and windows. The weekly podcast is ending, but we remain. Keep an eye on our Twitter and Tumblr for updates on what we\u2019re up to and where. This isn\u2019t the end, but we will miss you. Stay thirsty; the world needs it. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nIn our Plus segment, we share just a few of the Thirst Objects we weren\u2019t able to get to during the run of the show: Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, Aldis Hodge, Avan Jogia, and Rob Delaney. We couldn\u2019t give them full episodes, but here are some quick tasty morsels to hint at what might have been.\n\nOur music is by Tanya Morgan.
