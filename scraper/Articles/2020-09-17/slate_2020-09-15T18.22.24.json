{"authors": ["Heather Schwedel"], "body": "As recently as a decade ago, we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of sympathy for stars going through risqu\u00e9 photo or sex tape scandals. If they were dumb enough to take the photos or videos in the first place, the thinking went, they didn\u2019t deserve our compassion. Recent events prove that times have changed: This weekend, Captain America accidentally posted a dick pic, and sure, there was some snickering\u2014but it was strongly drowned out by his online fans\u2019 impromptu campaign to bury the photo.\n\nTo be a little more specific about what happened, on Saturday, the actor Chris Evans shared a screen recording of him and some companions playing a game to his Instagram Story\u2014good clean fun. But Evans apparently didn\u2019t realize that when the clip of the game ended, his photo roll popped up on screen, and there on his grid was a dick pic, presumably his own. (Also notable among the images in the photo roll: a meme featuring Evans\u2019 own face and the line \u201cGUARD. THAT. PUSSY.\u201d) Evans quickly took down the post, but not soon enough to stop some users from capturing it and sharing elsewhere.\n\nThe reaction might have gone another way, but Evans was buoyed by early support from fellow stars like Chrissy Teigen, who raised the good point that she has many boobs on her phone that don\u2019t belong to her, and Mark Ruffalo, who tried to show his bro the silver lining (that nothing could be more embarrassing than the U.S. president). At the same time, fans were organizing, urging other users to respect Evans\u2019 privacy by not further disseminating the photos. Some of these concerned fans pointed out that Evans has struggled with anxiety. These Evans supporters seemed to have learned a thing or two from the tactics K-pop fans successfully deployed earlier this year toward sabotaging a Trump rally and police efforts to surveil Black Lives Matters protesters: They used their collective power to flood Chris Evans\u2019 hashtag on Twitter with photos of the actor and puppies so that those images would appear before the dreaded screenshots in search results. In a twist, the story of an A-list actor\u2019s leaked dick pic seemed, on the whole, pretty wholesome.\n\nBut soon, the fallout entered a second, perhaps inevitable phase: The notion that this would have gone much differently if Chris Evans were a woman of similar stature began to bubble up. The actress Kat Dennings said as much in a tweet:\n\nThe public respect for Chris Evans\u2019 privacy/feelings is wonderful. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it extended to women when this kind of thing happens? \u2014 Kat Dennings (@OfficialKat) September 13, 2020\n\nThe Independent offered similar thoughts in a piece headlined \u201cChris Evans\u2019 Nude Picture Leak Would Have Happened Very Differently if He Was a Woman\u201d: The article asserted that \u201cwomen actors like Jennifer Lawrence whose nude pictures were leaked without their consent were blamed relentlessly and cruelly,\u201d referring to an infamous 2014 photo hack. Reddit\u2019s front page featured a post by a user who said he or she was \u201cproud of the internet\u201d for its reaction to Evans\u2019 pic, but the post also noted a possible double standard:\n\n[T]his reminded me of when female celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence got their icloud account hacked \u2026 How people blamed HER for taking nudes of HERSELF on HER own phone, and how she should expect to get hacked because she\u2019s a celebrity. I\u2019m hoping that the change in reaction between the two celebrities is because we, as a society, are learning and doing better, and not because of double standards, but I really can\u2019t tell, and don\u2019t want to see another celebrity nude leak from any gender happen to find out.\n\nThere\u2019s no disputing that men and women in the public eye are treated very differently, but it\u2019s an oversimplification to say that Lawrence was \u201cblamed relentlessly and cruelly\u201d when her photos were hacked and that Evans was spared. Lawrence garnered a great deal of support at the time, including a very sympathetic Vanity Fair cover story and widespread online outrage. She faced shrugs and finger-wagging from a predictable class of internet misogynists (and, uh, Clay Aiken), but it was hardly the overall tenor of the reaction. Her career didn\u2019t suffer in any obvious way. Evans, having accidentally leaked his own photo, isn\u2019t a victim in the same way Lawrence and other celebrities whose photos were stolen are. But the most powerful and mainstream reactions to these two incidents are actually more alike than not. Over the past 10 years, stars have gone from being shamed when private photos or videos get out to being treated as victims of a crime (some of Lawrence\u2019s perpetrators went to prison), or in Evans\u2019 case, as victims of unscrupulous actors who spread the photos online. At the same time, the act of taking nudes has basically become normalized. Put simply, they are less of a big deal, and the act of consuming them without permission has become guilty and shameful, even if some guys on Reddit try to justify it by saying the people in them had it coming.\n\nThat we\u2019re at a point where a sizable group of people understand that passing around an accidentally shared dick pic is a violation of consent is a #MeToo victory. But there are also X-factors at work here. Fans and the internet don\u2019t always deserve full credit for an enlightened stance. In fact, as much as Evans deserves the benefit of the doubt in this situation, his fans might be just as likely to jump to his defense if he didn\u2019t. Not definitely\u2014Potterheads are a recent example of fans disavowing a onetime hero\u2014but for every \u201cheartwarming\u201d interaction between a star and their fans, there\u2019s a counterexample of a famous person siccing their fans on an unsuspecting critic or fast food Twitter account that has supposedly wronged them. It felt particularly absurd for fans to suggest that people should stop circulating Evans\u2019 picture on social media because Evans has struggled with anxiety\u2014as opposed to all the other celebrities who haven\u2019t been diagnosed with any disorders, whose pictures would be fair game for gawking at? Stars who don\u2019t have as many or as powerful a legion of stans deserve some privacy and decency too. If Ben Affleck\u2014a star who, unlike Evans, public opinion seems to have soured on lately (don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be back)\u2014were to have some dick pics leak tomorrow, I suspect it would be a different story. But maybe Affleck will get slippery fingers and the internet will prove me wrong.\n\nIn any case, late Monday evening, Evans finally acknowledged his slip-up with characteristic public grace:\n\nNow that I have your attention\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f....\n\n\n\nVOTE Nov 3rd!!! \u2014 Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) September 15, 2020\n\nIt seems to have been received positively; it\u2019s got almost a million likes already.
