I\u2019d make a great roommate: I\u2019ve been in a relationship for about 3 months. My partner and I knew each other for about 6 years and were very close before we got together, and for the most part it\u2019s genuinely the best relationship I have ever been a part of: he\u2019s funny, sweet, ambitious, etc., but also since we\u2019ve been friends for so long, he\u2019s also really amazing with my 4-year-old son. I have a habit of \u201cfalling fast,\u201d and wanted to discuss the possibility of us moving in together when our leases are up next summer. He currently lives an hour away, and it\u2019s just nice to think about a future where we don\u2019t have to drive so much to get to see each other. Additionally, his current roommates are financially unreliable, causing him to have to work longer weeks just to make sure he will be able to cover whatever they don\u2019t pay. I have a good-paying job and could offer better financial security, but he won\u2019t hear it. Even though what we have is super solid, and he tells me all the time about how much he loves me and my son, he says a year from now would be too soon to consider living together. I\u2019m trying to make peace with this, but I really don\u2019t understand. I really want to respect his boundaries, but I honestly really feel like I would be the overall better roommate option: I\u2019m financially reliable, relatively clean, and my kid is pretty chill most of the time. Is there a way to broach this topic again without coming across as disrespectful?\n\nThe rest of this article is only for Slate Plus members.

If it would help to hear someone else summarize it, allow me: Your boyfriend loves you very much, but he\u2019s not ready to start talking about moving in together after a mere three months of dating (even though you\u2019ve known one another six years), and he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll want to move in together anytime in the next nine months, either. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the position: He loves you, he loves your kid, and he wants to take his time before moving in with your kid and taking on a much more involved, quasi-parental role. Before you say again how chill your kid is \u2013 and I believe he really is delightful! \u2013 deciding to move in with a partner with a four-year-old child is a pretty significant step, no matter how relaxed the four-year-old, and it\u2019s naive to suggest otherwise.\n\nI\u2019m sure you are a more responsible roommate than the people your boyfriend presently lives with. But so are many other people, and it\u2019s disingenuous to present your position as merely logistically superior (\u201cI pay my rent on time, and it would cut down on our commute if we lived together\u201d) when in fact it\u2019s what you want for the next stage of your relationship. That\u2019s fine; you don\u2019t have to apologize for falling fast, or for wanting to live with him. But you should acknowledge the fact that it is fast, that it\u2019s pretty unusual for couples to plan to move in together after just a few months of dating, and that it might in fact be better for your son to move ahead patiently, building up trust and intimacy and routine over time. You can bring this up again with your boyfriend, but I don\u2019t think you should say, \u201cExplain this to me again, because I just don\u2019t understand \u2013 I\u2019m such a great roommate.\u201d Say something more like this: \u201cYou know me well enough to know I tend to fall fast; I\u2019ve known you long enough to feel pretty confident about our relationship. I want to live with you. I think it would be a lot of fun, and I think we\u2019d all get along really well; I also understand why you want to wait a year or longer. But I hope we can talk about the possibility of living closer to one another (without living in the same house) if you decide you want new roommates once your lease is up, and I hope you\u2019ll let me know when you do feel ready to move in together.\u201d", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:10.909204", "publish_date": "2020-09-16", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-16 15:53:14.540000+00:00", "publish_time": "15:53:14", "source": "slate", "title": "When you're ready to move in with your boyfriend but he isn't, in this week's Dear Prudie Extra.", "topics": ["thats", "slate", "months", "youre", "ready", "prudie", "boyfriend", "isnt", "dont", "dear", "really", "think", "understand", "weeks", "relationship", "roommate", "pretty", "extra"]}
