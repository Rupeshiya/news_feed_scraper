{"authors": ["Willa Paskin"], "body": "Ryan Murphy\u2019s Ratched doesn\u2019t start well\u2014and not just because of the priests graphically bludgeoned, stabbed, and raped in the series\u2019 opening minutes. Like a musical act whose sound barely changes, Murphy puts out the same record over and over again, and how much you enjoy it depends on how many of the previous songs you already know by heart. With its bubblegum-tinged, glammed-up superviolence, where a soign\u00e9e bathrobe and a nearly decapitated man in the bathtub are both just a bit of mood-setting, Ratched seems like American Horror Story: For Netflix. The handsome murderer is even played by Finn Wittrock, a Murphy regular who has killed, tortured, and eaten someone in various AHS installments. He\u2019s mysteriously connected to the title character, nurse Mildred Ratched, played by Murphy muse Sarah Paulson, whose career leveled up with AHS: Asylum and now finds herself scheming in another mental health facility.\n\nNurse Ratched is one of the fictional characters who have made asylums such a ripe setting for horror. As played by Louise Fletcher in an Oscar-winning performance in 1975\u2019s One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, Ratched was an angelic-looking authoritarian, calmly controlling, the personification of a cruel and rigid system, who used electroshock and lobotomies when she couldn\u2019t keep her wards inline with a bit of psychological manipulation. Ratched purports to tell her origin story, although as it begins, she\u2019s a nightmare almost fully formed. In the opening episode, Mildred deftly insinuates herself onto the staff at California\u2019s Lucia State Hospital, where Wittrock\u2019s Edmund Tolleson will soon be moved. To do this, she blackmails and poisons, while occasionally being filmed in an emerald green light that visually underscores her kinship to the Wicked Witch. (You can track the amount of green in Paulson\u2019s every outfit as a kind of barometer of her mental state; the nurses\u2019 outfits are a deep sea foam.) She ingratiates herself with the head of the hospital, the ambitious Dr. Hanover (Jon Jon Briones), who hopes to make Lucia a beacon of humane care, a place where patients are healed, not penalized, using a powerful new technique: the lobotomy.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

Ratched is playing a game of connect the dots that goes way off the page and relies on at least one more season. (Eighteen episodes were ordered, and this season contains only eight.) Rather than descend to further villainy, Mildred ascends, slowly locating her morality, thanks primarily to the love of a good woman. In the second episode, as Mildred, at her sweetest and most innocent, is hand-fed oysters by Gwendolyn Briggs (Cynthia Nixon) above the thundering California surf, Ratched begins to reveals what Murphy et al. most want it to be\u2014not a horror story or an origin story, but a love story.\n\nNixon, who plays an advisor to the governor, blanches when Dr. Hanover explains that lobotomies can be used to cure, among other pathologies, lesbianism. (When she asks Ratched to lunch, she explains, in a sandwich-related context, that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like extruded meats.\u201d) Ratched, whose favorite food is baloney, thinks of homosexual urges as degenerate. Though Paulson and Nixon\u2019s chemistry is wildly overestimated by the show itself, their single oyster feast is enough to entangle the two, even though Mildred initially rejects her. Gwendolyn immediately decides to separate from her beard of a husband, and Ratched finds her mind wandering to Gwendolyn while she\u2019s taken from behind by a private investigator played by Corey Stoll. Mildred resists Gwendolyn even as they get closer, until she can\u2019t anymore, their whole story a swoony, Sirkian romance that plays out so quietly it takes episodes to reveal itself as the center of the show.\n\nThe feminist reading of Nurse Ratched has always been in the text: In Ken Kesey\u2019s novel, she\u2019s a big-bosomed tyrant and her wards are \u201cvictims of a matriarchy.\u201d Fletcher\u2019s version of Ratched feminized the character, using her delicate good looks to heighten the horror of her as the ultimate ball buster, an emasculator frostily in control of her charges. Paulson\u2019s version of Ratched can also be imperious and righteous\u2014in an echo of the film, she explicitly incites a patient to suicide\u2014but she\u2019s far less terrifying. Her relationship to her patients is not her primary one. She is instead, at the start, totally focused on her obligations to Tolleson, for whom she is willing to do just about anything. The long-teased-out nature of their bond\u2014and the incredible trauma and abuse they have sustained\u2014completely remakes Ratched, not as an avatar of the system, but a victim of it. In Kesey\u2019s novel, Ratched is the embodiment of the Combine, the mechanized society that destroys those who deviate from the norm\u2014but lo and behold, Ratched supposes Nurse Ratched herself to be a deviator. The resulting character, swoony in love, a loyal if misguided friend, a competent administrator, a practitioner only of techniques she believes help, is more sympathetic, but also more banal. No longer a chilling avatar of implacable, self-satisfied state violence who needs no reason to exist other than that the system will always find people like her to keep running, Nurse Ratched is now just another poor, misunderstood antihero.\n\nThe Nurse Ratched glow-up takes place amid the standard Murphy hijinks. There\u2019s a catfighting nursing crew led by Judy Davis\u2019 Nurse Bucket; a posturing psycho killer getting hand jobs from the staff turns into a Bonnie and Clyde story; Dr. Hanover explores hypnotism and multiple personalities as the lobotomy thing doesn\u2019t pan out; and then there\u2019s the gross zaniness involving Sharon Stone as a vengeful millionaire seeking retribution for her sociopathic son, now a quadruple amputee. All of this bangs away like a klaxon, even as Ratched\u2019s dawning realization that she might be \u201cthe sort of woman who enjoys the company of other women\u201d gives her the clarity to distance herself from a murderer to whom she feels responsible.\n\nBy the end of the season\u2014which again, is just halfway through the series\u2014Ratched has been almost completely made over as a heroine, and the character feels like little more than an occasion for longtime collaborators Murphy and Paulson to create their Sapphic opus, a fraternal twin to The Assassination of Gianni Versace, which was also about the uncomfortable connections between violence, trauma, psychosis, and homosexuality. Homosexuality is what saves Ratched, though\u2014or at least temporarily redeems her. By the end of the season, Lucia State Hospital is an all-female enterprise, catfights have given way to matriarchies, and Ratched is well on her way to getting the full feminist makeover, one that will likely reframe all her future behavior as the response of a justified misandrist\u2014or at least a comprehensible one. \u201cTrue monsters are made, not born,\u201d goes the show\u2019s tagline, but it\u2019s a misleading one. Season 1, as far as it goes, is about the death of a monster, and the birth of a lovely, if haunted, gay couple on permanent holiday in Mexico.", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:12.854306", "publish_date": "2020-09-16", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-16 10:00:00+00:00", "publish_time": "10:00:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Ratched: Sarah Paulson plays the iconic Cuckoo\u2019s Nest villain in Ryan Murphy\u2019s gory Netflix prequel.", "topics": ["state", "shes", "ryan", "mildred", "gwendolyn", "netflix", "nurse", "villain", "ratched", "season", "paulson", "murphy", "murphys", "plays", "played", "prequel", "horror", "nest", "sarah"]}
