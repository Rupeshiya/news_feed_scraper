{"authors": ["Nick Greene"], "body": "The 2020 NFL season was always going to be weird, but the sight of Tom Brady wearing a pirate-themed uniform is a particularly unsettling twist. The six-time Super Bowl champion made his Tampa Bay Buccaneers debut Sunday, and the first start of his post\u2013New England career was an inauspicious one. Brady threw for 239 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions in a 34\u201323 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Somewhere, Bill Belichick was smiling.\n\nJust kidding. Belichick was in Foxborough, glowering. But this was a relatively happy glower, for he got to watch Cam Newton, Brady\u2019s replacement, lead the Patriots to a comfortable 21\u201311 win over the Miami Dolphins. It was the sort of clinical, businesslike result New England fans came to expect during the 19-year Brady era, except for the fact that there were no fans and it was engineered by a guy who dresses like the star of Wes Anderson\u2019s Wario. A pretty normal afternoon, all things considered.\n\nThis will be Brady\u2019s 20th season and Newton\u2019s 10th. Both have fascinating and storied individual careers, but the two quarterbacks will be inexorably linked all season. While there will be plenty of opportunities to compare and contrast their performances, you only get one chance to make a first impression. Let\u2019s examine how theirs went.\n\n1. Opening scores\n\nBoth Brady and Newton opened their accounts with rushing touchdowns. Brady\u2019s came in the form of a QB sneak, and it was the kind of play we\u2019ve seen him do roughly 17,988,456 times during his career.\n\nNewton\u2019s run was more dynamic, as is to be expected, and he bounced outside before jogging into the end zone.\n\nMobility is the most obvious thing that separates Brady and Newton, even after the latter spent most of last season recovering from a Lisfranc injury (which is a hurt foot\u2014I had to Google it). The Patriots\u2019 new quarterback ran the ball 15 times for 75 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday. For reference, that\u2019s more than twice as many rushing yards than Brady had all last season (34).\n\nAs ESPN\u2019s Dan Graziano points out, Newton\u2019s 15 rushing attempts were the most he\u2019s ever had in a non-overtime game. The runs were deployed wisely, too: Eight of them resulted in first downs.\n\n2. Turnovers\n\nWithout a preseason, rust is to be expected. Brady, meanwhile, may or may not have been holding illegal workouts with his teammates during the pandemic. Even so, some of his throws were shockingly bad. His two interceptions were, as they say in Paris, Peterman-esque.\n\nJUMP MAN! \ud83d\ude4c@MarcusWilliams with the huge INT off Tom Brady\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: @NFLonFOX pic.twitter.com/0Q6Njysna5 \u2014 New Orleans Saints (@Saints) September 13, 2020\n\nSunday\u2019s loss was the third consecutive game in which Brady threw a pick-six. If he keeps this up, he will be remembered as a fun bit of trivia: Did you know the guy who threw all those pick-sixes in a row also won six Super Bowls? His name was Tom Brady, and he never ate tomatoes.\ufeff\n\nNewton, on the other hand, played within himself. His passing statistics were modest\u201415-for-19 for 155 yards\u2014but there were no turnovers, unlike that pick-six guy whose name escapes me.\n\n3. New tutelage\n\nTom Brady had the same coach for 19 straight seasons. That much time together can strain any relationship, even one with somebody as bubbly and forgiving as Bill Belichick. Tampa Bay represents a fresh start for the 43-year-old quarterback, and let\u2019s check in on how his honeymoon period with coach Bruce Arians is going.\n\nBruce Arians put both interceptions on Brady. Said on that first one, Mike Evans read the coverage right but Brady did not. #Buccaneers \u2014 Michael Giardi (@MikeGiardi) September 14, 2020\n\nArians amended his analysis today, saying the first INT was on Evans. https://t.co/RYQz3BYPBk \u2014 Michael Giardi (@MikeGiardi) September 14, 2020\n\nBruce Arians may have amended his blame on Tom Brady for one of those INTs but still didn't like what he saw from 12. \"He looked like Tom Brady in practice all the time so it\u2019s kind of unusual to see that in a ballgame because they didn\u2019t do things that we didn\u2019t get ready for.\" \u2014 Michael Giardi (@MikeGiardi) September 14, 2020\n\nChange is fun!\n\nMeanwhile in New England, something odd is happening.\n\nBill Belichick on Cam Newton: \u201cHe puts himself last and puts his team first. He\u2019s done a tremendous job there.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ny1pghdhzT \u2014 Henry McKenna (@McKennAnalysis) September 13, 2020\n\nWe don\u2019t have to grade that on a curve. It\u2019s not praise \u2026 \u201cfor Belichick,\u201d but rather genuine, real praise from one human to another. What the hell is happening?\n\n4. Opponents\n\nFor 19 straight summers, Tom Brady sat down and wrote \u201cBuffalo Bills,\u201d \u201cNew York Jets,\u201d and \u201cMiami Dolphins\u201d on his calendar. Then, he wrote \u201cBuffalo Bills (away),\u201d \u201cNew York Jets (away),\u201d and \u201cMiami Dolphins (away)\u201d on that same calendar. Such are the benefits of playing in the AFC East.\n\nOn Sunday, however, he had to play the New Orleans Saints. They are not the New York Jets. They are good. He will have to play them again later this season, because he is no longer in the AFC East. The games should get easier for the Bucs, but the opener was a gentle reminder that not everyone gets to play the Jets twice.\n\nNewton\u2019s task on Sunday may have looked easy on paper, but the Miami Dolphins can be a tricky bunch. Hell, they beat Tom Brady and the Patriots in Week 17 last year and cost New England a bye. You can\u2019t take them for granted. Unlike the Jets. Whom Newton gets to play twice.\n\n5. Aesthetics\n\nThe most important issue when an established star suits up for a new team is how weird they look in the uniform. Newton didn\u2019t have to leap very far on the Pantone scale from Panther blue to Patriot blue, and the quarterback wore his new duds well.\n\nBrady, meanwhile, has a steeper mountain to climb. For nearly two decades the image of him wearing a Patriots jersey had seared itself into the brain of every football fan, so any new uniform he decides to put on is bound to look weird. But the Bucs? That\u2019s a jersey tailored for the likes of Brad Johnson or Brian Griese. The goofy pirate-flag helmet should be on the head of Mike Glennon, not an Aston Martin spokesmodel.\n\nOf course Brady struggled against the Saints. Just look at him.\n\nAnd to think, he didn\u2019t even wear the orange jersey on Sunday. It could be a long season.\n\nListen to an episode of Slate\u2019s sports podcast, Hang Up and Listen, below, or subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:13.084139", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 20:12:13.616000+00:00", "publish_time": "20:12:13", "source": "slate", "title": "The Five Defining Differences Between Cam Newton and Tom Brady on Opening Day", "topics": ["belichick", "jets", "brady", "patriots", "defining", "day", "tom", "play", "didnt", "season", "newton", "opening", "cam", "saints", "differences"]}
