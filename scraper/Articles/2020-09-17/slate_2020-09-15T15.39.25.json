{"authors": ["June Thomas"], "body": "Over the past six months, turning on the TV has been like journeying to a distant planet where huge numbers of maskless people cluster in confined spaces, shaking hands and kissing. Then again, I\u2019m not exactly craving representations of the way we live now. After an isolated workday studded with Zoom meetings, I for one have very little interest in devoting my leisure hours to staring at famous people doing the same.\n\nEnter Away, the new Netflix series in which Hilary Swank plays the American commander of a three-year international mission to Mars. In a way that surely wasn\u2019t in creator Andrew Hinderaker\u2019s original plan, its two main settings\u2014Mission Control in Texas and the Atlas blasting its way through space\u2014have come to represent the pre- and post-COVID worlds. Filmed before the pandemic, the scenes in Houston play out in open-plan offices packed with scientists, crowded living rooms where friends and colleagues celebrate significant events, and schools where kids congregate in classrooms and hallways. Meanwhile, loosed from the bonds of Earth, the five residents of Atlas live inside the ultimate bubble. Squint and their space suits look like PPE, instructions from Mission Control like new guidelines from the CDC, and crew members\u2019 video chats with faraway family members like, well, our own video chats with faraway family members. They\u2019re not so much working from home as living at work\u2014with their bosses monitoring their every move and mood. It\u2019s good to know things could be worse.\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture newsletter The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.

The show\u2019s formula reveals itself within the first couple of episodes, only to be endlessly repeated. There\u2019ll be problems with the ship and the water supply and everything else required to keep the mission viable\u2014the same problems that have cropped up in the hundreds of other recent movies and TV shows set in zero gravity\u2014and they\u2019ll be solved in identical ways, with reckless acts of bravery, brilliant solutions dreamed up by loved ones back on Earth, and plain dumb luck.\n\nAtlas may be up in the stars, but the show\u2019s interpersonal stakes are pathetically low, which is especially disappointing given that Jason Katims, who made Friday Night Lights and Parenthood, is part of Away\u2019s creative team. The focus on family and family-like structures that was so productive in those shows is present here, but, perhaps because millions of miles separate husbands and wives and parents and children, the connections never quite jell. The togetherness is all in flashback, and even back before blastoff, the relationships don\u2019t seem all that special. In moments of extreme bonding between Swank\u2019s Emma Green and her husband, fellow astronaut Matt Logan (Josh Charles), they whisper their pet name for one other: \u201cShithead.\u201d It\u2019s no \u201cClear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose.\u201d\n\nOut in space, Emma, Indian Ram Arya (Ray Panthaki), Chinese Lu Wang (Vivian Wu), Russian Misha Popov (Mark Ivanir), and British Ghanaian Kwesi Weisberg-Abban (Ato Essandoh) each get an episode in the spotlight, usually facilitated by a prop. Each crew member got to bring a personal item into space\u2014a family photo for Ram, a ring for Lu, puppets for Misha, and a religious text for Kwesi\u2014triggering a flashback that reveals the significance of the object. But it\u2019s as if the episodes were written by people who don\u2019t know what happens in the rest of the season. When Lu, who has a husband and son in Beijing, is revealed to have fallen in love with another woman from the Chinese space program, Misha treats her with homophobic disdain \u2026 until the next episode, when he seems to have forgotten all about it.\n\nThere is one exception to the parade of consequence-free blandness, and perhaps it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that it comes in a story about contagion. In the fourth episode, \u201cExcellent Chariots,\u201d Ram contracts infectious mononucleosis and begs to be shot into space rather than endanger the health of his crewmates. Emma disobeys orders and tends to him, despite his repeated pleas for her to stay away. As he recovers, he tells her what viewers have pieced together from flashbacks: As a boy, Ram had typhus, and despite their mother\u2019s instructions to the contrary, his big brother, Rohit, visited frequently, entertaining Ram with tales of Hindu gods and space travel\u2014until Rohit succumbed to the disease. The survivor\u2019s guilt that tortures Ram is one of the first fictional representations of a fear that is keeping thousands of families apart today. It\u2019s still so rare to see today\u2019s strange emotional landscape mirrored on screen that for a few moments at least, this predictable, mediocre show feels truly remarkable and perhaps even profound.", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:08.310140", "publish_date": "2020-09-15", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-15 15:39:25.972000+00:00", "publish_time": "15:39:25", "source": "slate", "title": "Netflix's Away finds familiarity in an episode about contagion threatening a mission to Mars.", "topics": ["threatening", "space", "mission", "family", "way", "tv", "signing", "contagion", "away", "familiarity", "episode", "ram", "misha", "shows", "mars", "netflixs", "finds", "members"]}
