My grandfather, who didn\u2019t know how to keep things in his pants, ended up giving it to one of his mistresses. My grandmother mourned the loss of the necklace until the day she died. Recently I happened to stumble across the necklace, or what I think is the necklace, on eBay. I questioned my grandfather and contacted the seller, and both parties think it\u2019s possible this necklace belonged to my grandmother. I wanted it back, but when I tried to discuss it with the seller; she said she was selling it for a reason, and if I really wanted it back, I would pay her either the asking price or more. I am not sure what to do next. She has thankfully taken it down, but I feel like I am being blackmailed. Any thoughts?\n\n\u2014Affair of the Necklace\n\nA few, yes. Let\u2019s start with the good news: You\u2019re not being blackmailed. A stranger is selling her necklace, which both she and your grandfather believe is \u201cpossibly\u201d a gift he once gave his mistress. The necklace has presumably been in her possession for a fairly long time, and there are a number of reasons this stranger might not want to ask her relative, who may no longer be living, \u201cHey, did you get this necklace from a man who was cheating on his wife with you?\u201d\n\nIf you can afford to buy the necklace, and you\u2019d like to, you can get back in touch and make an offer. But just because you saw something that looks a lot like the necklace your grandfather gave away doesn\u2019t mean the stranger selling it should hand it over on demand. If you\u2019re still feeling unsettled, I think a more productive use of your time would be to speak with your grandfather about how his cheating and secret gift-giving hurt and confused your grandmother, and how that in turn has affected you. But don\u2019t try to work through your family\u2019s dirty laundry at this stranger\u2019s expense.\n\nGet Prudie in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

He has two brothers, one single and one married. The married brother supports his wife, who stays home with their two kids. I am very different from my husband\u2019s relatives, and we live in different states, so I have a polite but separate relationship with them. My husband has never been great at the nitty-gritty. He loses his keys, misses appointments, forgets conversations. It\u2019s annoying, but no one is perfect, and it is what it is. Because of this, I manage most details of our home life. I make grocery lists, make or delegate dinner, manage the kids\u2019 appointments, take the dogs to the vet, etc. I have drawn the line at his extended family.\n\nHis sister-in-law is really particular about details and becomes enraged if my husband doesn\u2019t call his niece and nephew on their birthday and have a present waiting for them at their house. You know where this is going. He \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d remember to do this. He forgot again this year and just received the inevitable nastygram from SIL. It is putting our relationship with their family at risk. My family isn\u2019t big on birthdays, so I just don\u2019t understand this rage or her expectations. Also, I feel I do enough of the household minutiae. I don\u2019t want this job. Am I maritally obligated to do this to save their relationship? Can we tell them they are being ridiculous, and it isn\u2019t worth losing family over this?\n\n\u2014Not Another Domestic Task, Please\n\nYou say you\u2019ve drawn the line at managing your husband\u2019s relationship with his extended family, so draw the line here. Whether it\u2019s petty on your sister-in-law\u2019s part or the last straw after a series of forgotten birthdays and other milestones, I think it\u2019s important for you not to take up your husband\u2019s cause here. It\u2019s not just about making an arbitrary stand to force your husband into greater self-sufficiency, either. What frustrates your sister-in-law is that your husband doesn\u2019t think about her kids, so even if you did start sending gifts on his behalf or signing his name to a yearly card, the underlying problem of his inattention would still remain. You can\u2019t save their relationship if he simply doesn\u2019t care about hurting her feelings, ignoring his niece and nephew, or navigating conflict with his side of the family. You can say, \u201cThis habit of yours is putting our relationship with that side of your family at risk. What do you want to do about it? What do you want to say to your sister-in-law? What do you want to say to your niece and nephew?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to get too lost in the weeds about what your husband \u201ccan\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d do, whether there\u2019s an executive-function disorder that may be at play here or whether he\u2019s simply learned he can get the women in his life to manage his problems for him. But I imagine that if he\u2019s in a high-powered, high-stress job, he is not in the habit of \u201cforgetting\u201d details at work, like what day a big meeting is scheduled for. I do believe that if your husband put in the effort and took his habits into account, he is capable of setting a calendar reminder on his phone to call his niece and nephew on their birthdays and for sending a small gift to their house. That is not beyond his resources, and he now has a year to plan ahead for the next one.\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\n\u2022 Send questions for publication to prudence@slate.com.

I look different, but I don\u2019t feel like an entirely new person. I have always liked myself and known my worth. In the past six months, several of my friends have asked me out. Two of them had turned me down (kindly) back when I was a bigger size. The third is my close friend and long-term crush, Michael. I do have feelings for him, and the thought of kissing him makes my mouth run dry. At the same time, I\u2019m still processing how much better people treat me now that I\u2019m thin. It\u2019s painful to navigate, and while Michael has always been great to me, I become anxious whenever I think about the role my skinniness played in his attraction to me. I want to date Michael, but I don\u2019t know how to start or have this conversation with him.\n\n\u2014Suddenly Popular\n\nTwo things are of equal importance here. The first is that if you go out with Michael without ever discussing these fears, I think part of you will always wonder what he \u201creally\u201d thinks of you, and you\u2019ll spend a lot of time speculating what you\u2019re too afraid to ask him about. The second is that you can bring this up with him without feeling as if you have to quiz him for the one correct answer. This man is a dear friend of yours and presumably treats you with sensitivity and respect. If you were to say to him, \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to talk about this, since a lot of it\u2019s very new to me, but one of the stranger things about having lost weight is realizing how differently people treat me when I\u2019m thinner. Sometimes it painfully highlights just how little they thought of me when I was fat. I\u2019m not looking for advice or reassurance from you, but I want to be able to talk about it together,\u201d you\u2019d be leaving a lot of room for an honest conversation on the subject. Pay attention to his response and consider what it is that you\u2019d need to hear from him in order to consider going on that date.\n\nMost importantly, I hope you don\u2019t dismiss your concerns or desires out of fear that you\u2019ll lose this new, kinder, more attentive treatment from others if you act insufficiently grateful, especially since you say this isn\u2019t just about romantic interest but how everyone treats you across the board. You have a right to be frustrated\u2014or any other of a host of possible reactions\u2014upon realizing just how much politeness, friendliness, and general interest others withheld from you based on your size.\n\nHelp!

The wedding was later postponed due to the pandemic, and I haven\u2019t even taken the cash out of its envelope. Now we\u2019ve had a falling-out, because he and my partner have had a protracted fight, and he\u2019s ended their friendship. Though I understand the feelings on both sides, I\u2019m also hurt by the way my friend has been treating my partner. I\u2019ve put our own friendship on pause indefinitely. The idea of using this money makes me sad now. He has no respect for my partner anymore, and he\u2019s moving out of our shared apartment soon. Do I give him back this money? Do I talk to him about it? Leave a note? I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u2014Tainted Cash\n\nI think it\u2019s as simple as this sentence: \u201cThe idea of using this money makes me sad now.\u201d I suspect you\u2019ll feel an increased sense of ease and flexibility if you give it back either with a gracious note or a brief but kind conversation thanking him for his generosity but explaining that under the present circumstances you can\u2019t accept his gift. That\u2019s not to say it would be wrong to keep it\u2014a gift is a gift, after all. But it doesn\u2019t sound as if you and your partner had planned your wedding with this particular gift in mind, so you don\u2019t stand to lose much by returning it. Giving it back may even make a future reconciliation (or at least a kinder, mutually respectful parting of ways) easier, since you won\u2019t feel guilty or strange for using a gift offered in happier times and under such different emotional circumstances. If you do try to return it and your friend refuses, consider donating it to an organization whose mission you both support.\n\nDear Prudence Uncensored\n\n\u201cThe problem here is that these two women are driving themselves to distraction trying to care about something this one guy refuses to care about at all.\u201d\n\nDanny Lavery and special guest Christian Brown discuss a letter in this week\u2019s Dear Prudence Uncensored\u2014only for Slate Plus members.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for six months. We intend to move in together in another three months. She is not out to her family, and it\u2019s starting to wear on me. I don\u2019t want to push her to do something she isn\u2019t ready for, but she regularly sees and talks to them, and they still don\u2019t know. Her mom and sister are aware of our relationship, but she\u2019s worried that the rest (dad, aunts and uncles, grandparents) won\u2019t approve. I totally get that. I didn\u2019t have a great coming-out experience with my family, but now I am completely out and open. It\u2019s tough that our relationship is getting more serious while she still hides who I am to the rest of her family. I don\u2019t want to ask her to come out before she\u2019s ready, but I feel less legitimate as her partner right now. How can I stop feeling insecure about this?\n\n\u2014Moving In, Not Out\n\nI cannot help you feel less insecure about your partner\u2019s closetedness, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an appropriate role for you to play. It\u2019s one thing to respect someone else\u2019s right to decide when and where to come out, even if that person is your girlfriend. But that doesn\u2019t mean your job is to keep your opinions and feelings to yourself. If she\u2019s regularly visiting her family and intends to continue doing so when you two are going to be living together, that has a direct effect on you, and it\u2019s very much your business.\n\nI\u2019d strongly encourage you to reconsider moving in together before you\u2019ve had a serious conversation about when or if she intends to come out to the rest of her family, or at least the relatives she sees the most often. I\u2019m not suggesting you announce, \u201cEither you come out to your father tomorrow or I\u2019m renewing my lease alone\u201d over today\u2019s lunch. But moving in together is a serious step that pulls your lives together in new and profound ways, and you have a right to be concerned about how much her closetedness could affect you as a live-in partner. Does she intend to have any of these relatives over to visit your new apartment, and if so, does she plan to tell them you\u2019re just a friend? Do you think that\u2019s something you\u2019re comfortable going along with? You two have to be able to talk about these things, even if you don\u2019t immediately arrive at a workable compromise. Changing your mind or putting that move-in date off for a few months while you sort out your conflicting goals and priorities is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. If she\u2019s not ready to come out to the rest of her family but she does anticipate seeing them often, and you decide as a result that you\u2019re not ready to move in with her, you wouldn\u2019t be forcing her to do something she isn\u2019t really ready for. You\u2019d just be saying what you\u2019re not ready for.\n\nNow available in your podcast player: the audiobook edition of Danny M. Lavery\u2019s latest book, Something That May Shock and Discredit You. Get it from Slate.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy partner got laid off in the middle of the pandemic and is now home all day, every day. We can\u2019t really go outside (due to wildfire smoke), nor can he apply for jobs on his laptop from a coffee shop or something (due to the pandemic). I always worked at an office, but my company is having everyone work from home until there\u2019s a vaccine. We live in a studio and are driving each other up the wall. I\u2019m fiercely introverted, and I\u2019m struggling to adjust to work-from-home while I\u2019m in the same room as him all the time. It\u2019s starting to hurt our relationship when I\u2019m brusque with him. In the evenings after work, all I want to do is just get some space from him, which he is hurt by. What can we do to make this tenable?\n\n\u2014No Space Left\n\nAnything you can do to establish even a modicum of privacy, especially while you\u2019re working, will go a long way toward minimizing the frustrating sense of never being alone: purchasing noise-canceling headphones; setting up a workstation that faces a window, a wall, or generally away from wherever your partner\u2019s hanging out; blocking off a half-hour of downtime as your \u201ccommute\u201d at the end of your workday where you and your partner politely pretend you can\u2019t see each other before you start cooking together. Yes, it may feel forced and artificial, especially at first, but you just don\u2019t have many better options right now. Knowing there\u2019s a part of the day where you\u2019ll get to be by yourself can go a long way toward bolstering your reserves.\n\nEveryone needs at least some time to themselves, and there\u2019s a world of difference between wanting to be with your partner and being trapped inside a single room together because it\u2019s dangerous to breathe outside your door. Craving that time doesn\u2019t mean your partner\u2019s not lovely to be around. It just means you\u2019re in an ongoing crisis situation, and you need a few minutes every day to decompress before you can make civil conversation over the dinner table.\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI was raised by an abusive, alcoholic mother who told me that the only reason she chose not to abort me was so my brother would have someone to use as a punching bag, which he did. She was a psychopathic woman who became violent when she drank. She even stabbed me once. Then my father was killed, directly as a result of her abuse, and she committed suicide a few months later. As an adult I\u2019ve come to accept my past and use it to firm my resolve to be a better parent when the time comes. I recently married and have explained everything to my husband. But his family has started to ask about my parents and how they passed away. I don\u2019t regret my mother\u2019s suicide. She was an evil, callous, heartless woman. But I don\u2019t want to share this, or how my father died. My husband\u2019s family is my family, too, now, and the in-laws feel they have a right to some answers. While a part of me agrees, I feel that we would all regret it if I did share. How can I put an end to the questions about my past and specifically my parents\u2019 deaths?", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:11.795658", "publish_date": "2020-09-17", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-17 09:58:00+00:00", "publish_time": "09:58:00", "source": "slate", "title": "Dear Prudence: I think I\u2019m being blackmailed.", "topics": ["partner", "family", "im", "youre", "dont", "dear", "necklace", "think", "feel", "relationship", "husband", "blackmailed", "prudence"]}
