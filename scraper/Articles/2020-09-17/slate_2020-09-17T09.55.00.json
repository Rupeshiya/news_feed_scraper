Since supporting my children\u2019s virtual learning, I\u2019ve noticed that, while they have excellent vocabulary mastery and clear strength in pronunciation when reading, each of them struggles with retention of the content. This applies to academic and leisure reading. I notice it with both of my children, but particularly my 7-year-old, who\u2019s in second grade. What am I doing wrong? How do I help them take away more of what they read?\n\n\u2014Wanting to Raise a Reader\n\nDear Wanting,\n\n\u201cThe best thing you can do to increase your child\u2019s retention is to get them thinking while reading.\u201d \u2014 Matthew Dicks\n\nFirst, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. If your children are reading on a regular basis, you are winning. Congratulations.\n\nThe best thing you can do to increase your child\u2019s retention is to get them thinking while reading. It\u2019s something teachers spend an enormous amount of time doing in school. We need to shift students from simply reading the words and sentences to thinking about the text as they read. This often comes in the form of asking oneself questions, making predictions, and pausing to consider what was just learned.\n\nYou can assist this process by modeling it when reading to your children. When reading to your children, stop and think aloud. Show them how a reader\u2019s mind works. Make your own predictions. Ask yourself questions. Make statements that begin with phrases like \u201cI wonder\u201d and \u201cThis surprises me because\u201d and \u201cThis is interesting because.\u201d Teachers do this all day long.\n\nWhen your children are doing the reading themselves (or once they have finished reading), you can have them do the same thing. Ask them things like:\n\n\u2022 What are you wondering about?\n\n\u2022 What surprised you?\n\n\u2022 What do you think will happen next?\n\n\u2022 What would you like to learn more about?\n\n\u2022 Who is your favorite character, and why?\n\n\u2022 What does this author do well or not so well?\n\n\u2022 Whom would you recommend this book to, and why?\n\n\u2022 If they were going to turn this book into a movie, who do you think should play the lead role?\n\n\u2022 What was the most interesting fact that you learned today?\n\nShifting your child from a person who reads words to a person who thinks deeply about story will help your child gain a deeper understanding of the text and, as a result, retain more of what they are reading.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\u2014Mr. Dicks (fifth grade teacher, Connecticut)\n\nSlate needs your support right now. Sign up for Slate Plus to keep reading the advice you crave every week.\n\nI just graduated from college last May and am hoping to either become a high school language teacher or go into academia. Like a lot of people, however, my postgrad plans were thrown into complete disarray by the COVID-19 pandemic. I have a great opportunity lined up for next January overseas, but I have had a lot of employment difficulties in the meantime. I ended up moving back in with my parents and landed a job as a substitute teacher at a local elementary school. Each classroom at this school has a teacher and an assistant teacher, so when I substitute, I always take the role of assistant teacher. I consider myself pretty lucky to have this job, since our area doesn\u2019t really have opportunities in my field of interest outside of education, and getting a job in education is hard when I plan to be out of the country by next year. However, this substitute teaching job is making me absolutely miserable.\n\nThe school is a direct-instruction, classical-curriculum charter school. The curriculum is honestly pretty boring, and they expect students to be still and silent at their desks all day, especially since they are attempting to hold in-person classes during a pandemic. The kids in the younger grades are, understandably, terrible at this. They want to fidget and talk with their friends, but some days they don\u2019t even get the opportunity to go to recess. The teachers seem to immediately start the day irritated with their students (and there is only one class per grade, so I know I haven\u2019t just had bad luck in the teachers I work with), and the students can obviously tell. Though I do sometimes help out with individual work, most of the teachers seem to think of my job mainly as order-keeper. However, the students often don\u2019t listen to the new substitute, and I just can\u2019t bring myself to get angry or yell (the tactic taken by a lot of these teachers) at kids who just want to behave like kids instead of doing boring work in perfect silence for seven hours straight. I leave each day feeling drained and frustrated, but I don\u2019t want to quit because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find any better opportunities.\n\nMy training was pretty sparse, I\u2019ve never taken an education class, and most of my education experience is with teenagers (which I loved!), so when I\u2019m trying to manage the classroom, I feel completely at a loss. How do you make 6-to-8-year-olds listen to you without blowing up at them? And how can I help make their classroom experience more positive when they are in this difficult circumstance with not-so-sympathetic adults?\n\n\u2014Newbie\n\nDear Newbie,\n\nI\u2019m sorry. That sounds like a nightmare. First, I think you should accept that you, as a sub for a few months, will not create a culture shift at this school. That\u2019s what the school needs, but it\u2019s not your responsibility, nor is it possible.\n\nSo let me answer your questions.\n\nMy first year in the classroom, I was teaching third grade. My class was wild and needy, and I was terrible at the job. I was ill-equipped. I was exhausted. I yelled. A lot. One afternoon, I told a veteran teacher with tears in my eyes that I didn\u2019t know how to get the kids to do what I was asking. He said, \u201cWhen you see someone doing the wrong thing, acknowledge the kid who\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d That is, focus on praising positive behaviors rather than correcting negative ones.\n\nIt\u2019s not magic, but it works a lot. I still do it 19 years later with my eighth graders.\n\n\u201cThank you for taking out your notes on theme, Jackie.\u201d \u201cMarshall is referring to his essay rubric to revise. Nice work, Marshall.\u201d \u201cSonya\u2019s not going to have any homework because she\u2019s so focused on getting the task done before the bell.\u201d\n\nSometimes I acknowledge the positive behavior to the whole class; sometimes I tap the kid\u2019s shoulder and tell them privately.\n\nIf no child is doing the right thing, don\u2019t worry. You can just say, \u201cI like the way \u2026 \u201d and start looking around the room. Six-to-8-year-olds in particular will straighten up and start scrambling to figure out something to do that the teacher likes.\n\nThere\u2019s a larger conversation to be had about \u201cteacher-pleasing behaviors\u201d\u2014i.e., they\u2019re not necessarily good pedagogy. But considering your situation, this is a simple technique you can implement that addresses both your questions: how to make kids listen without blowing up and how to make the kids\u2019 experience more positive. Good luck!\n\n\u2014Ms. Scott (eighth grade teacher, North Carolina)\n\nI\u2019m a high school teacher at a public school for kids who aren\u2019t successful at the big high schools, so I have experience dealing with students with varying degrees of trauma in their lives. This year, I have a new student with a diagnosed behavior disorder called oppositional defiance disorder, and I\u2019m at a loss. This student attends school every day (our district allowed for a choice\u2014about one-third of our students chose remote, and two-thirds are in school), and their family life is tenuous. They have a 504 plan, and my school has limited special education resources. We\u2019re a few weeks in, and they have yet to complete an assignment in my class, won\u2019t keep their phone put away, talk across the room to a friend at full voice while I\u2019m talking, etc. They\u2019re having issues in all their classes, but no one has really come up with a solution. They get sent to the resource room but won\u2019t follow the rules, or get sent to the office or sent home for the day. But the next day is the same.\n\nThis feels like the kind of situation where we need outside guidance. Should my administration be contacting someone besides our building\u2019s counselor? Their parents are not helpful, and I\u2019m at a loss. I\u2019m dreading my class with them in it, and I feel completely unprepared to reach them in a way that will make an impact. And I feel guilty for feeling that way.\n\n\u2014Feeling Helpless\n\nDear Feeling Helpless,\n\nThis is a very frustrating situation! My heart goes out to you. This student definitely needs a behavior improvement plan, or BIP. I agree that the administration should immediately seek the support of a behavior specialist. Your school may have limited resources, but your district should have someone on staff who can help.\n\nOne hurdle you might run into, though, is that this student has a 504 plan, not an individualized education program, or IEP. Because 504 is not a federally funded program, your school district may reserve the support of behavior specialists solely for students in special education. (See this brief explainer from Understood about the differences between an IEP and a 504 plan.) I hope that is not the case!\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to get support from a specialist, the school should call a 504 meeting to address the student\u2019s behavior. If they don\u2019t already have a BIP, the 504 committee needs to write one. I am far from an expert in how to best support students with ODD, but I do know that one of the most important things they need is consistency. All staff members who work with this student must implement the BIP with fidelity.\n\nStudent behaviors like those you described present teachers with many challenges. Take a deep breath and pace yourself! It\u2019s a marathon, not a race. When I\u2019ve had difficult students, I\u2019ve found that the key is often to forge a positive relationship. It\u2019s not easy, I know. Put on a brave face and smile at them, even if you are secretly dreading it. And try to get to know them personally. If, over time, this student sees you as a positive, calm, and consistent adult in their life, they may settle into the routine of your class and present you with fewer disruptions. Fingers crossed!\n\n\u2014Ms. Holbrook (high school teacher, Texas)\n\nI\u2019m a college student currently pursuing a degree in education along with my certification. I\u2019m starting my observations this year, but with the pandemic we might not be able to see real classrooms. I guess you could say I\u2019m looking for any little bits of wisdom you could offer. I keep holding on to what a favorite teacher of mine told me last year as I graduated, about letting my love of learning drive me, but I could use a little more help. Any words of encouragement for learning how to be a teacher when you don\u2019t really get to see the teacher?\n\n\u2014All the Teaching I Cannot See\n\nDear AtTICS,\n\nThanks for reaching out. You\u2019re definitely in a uniquely challenging position. As educators we have to show the same resilience as our students, and I\u2019m sure you, too, will rise to the occasion! The best wisdom I can give you is to focus less on the environment\u2014being in the classroom can only tell you so much\u2014and to turn your focus solely on the students.\n\nIn the early years of my career, I spent so much time on refining my practice\u2014focusing on how to effectively deliver a lesson, how to teach kids to use manipulatives, how to encourage student voice and participation\u2014that I often missed the real needs of my students. During your observations, don\u2019t worry about missing out on the classroom dynamics, and spend your time really closely observing the students. Ask yourself which students are responding, who needs to take more time on their work, who hasn\u2019t spoken, and most importantly why. There\u2019s no doubt this year will present a great challenge to our entire educational system. But if we keep our focus on our students and their needs, we will be OK. Best of luck to you as you begin your journey. You are needed now more than ever.\n\n\u2014Mr. Hersey (second grade teacher, Washington)\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nWe have a conundrum.
