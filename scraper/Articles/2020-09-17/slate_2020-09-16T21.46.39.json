{"authors": ["Dahlia Lithwick"], "body": "Bill Barr is on yet another one of his charm offenses. Well, you can\u2019t really call it charming\u2014but it is most certainly offensive.\n\nAll is not well at the Justice Department, for a change. Last week, we learned that Nora Dannehy had resigned suddenly and unexpectedly as No. 2 to Connecticut\u2019s U.S. attorney, John Durham\u2014the man helming the Barr-endorsed investigation of the FBI\u2019s probe into the connections between Russia and the 2016 elections. According to Dannehy\u2019s colleagues, the resignation was at least partly motivated \u201cout of concern that the investigative team is being pressed for political reasons to produce a report before its work is done.\u201d Last week also saw Deputy Assistant AG David Morrell\u2014one of the DOJ lawyers handling the investigation into whether John Bolton released classified information in his book, among other things\u2014announcing that he too was leaving the Justice Department and withdrawing from all his cases. And this week we also learned that the DOJ\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office has begun investigating the extremely hinky circumstances surrounding the final sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, a sentence lighter than recommended by career prosecutors who ended up walking off the case in protest.\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.

He also did a friendly sit-down with the Chicago Tribune on Friday, in which he chuckled with John Kass about steakhouses, Chicago crime bosses, and re-upped his entirely imaginary claims about the perils of mail-in voting. And then there was this barnstormer appearance on CNN, when he assured Americans that their votes would be stolen. America\u2019s lawyer is hard at work at the critical task of freaking out the electorate.\n\nIn recent days, Barr appears to have inched away from his earlier claims that voting by mail was uniquely susceptible to foreign election tampering. Having pressed that particular hypothesis in early June in an interview with the New York Times, then in a July House Judiciary Committee hearing (a hearing in which he also testified he had no reason to believe the election would be rigged), he parroted the president\u2019s unfounded talking points about foreign interference for just mail-in ballots. Barr was asked about it again this month by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, who requested some basis for his now-frequent claims that \u201ca foreign country could send thousands of fake ballots, thousands of fake ballots to people, and it might be impossible to detect.\u201d Barr replied, \u201cI\u2019m basing that\u2014as I\u2019ve said repeatedly, I\u2019m basing that on logic.\u201d Barr continues to insist then that foreign counterfeiting of mail-in ballots is a legitimate threat for which he has no evidence or proof.\n\nBut the foreign tampering story is not sufficient to his purposes, and so Barr has deftly turned his sights once again on the enemy within. His newest claim seems to be that it\u2019s Americans, not foreigners, who will steal the 2020 election\u2014by buying, selling, browbeating, and intimidating otherwise good and honest voters who attempt to vote by mail. In that same CNN interview, Barr was testing the new theory: that it would be domestic, not foreign, enemies who will tamper with mail-in-ballots. While he had no idea how often this new vote harvesting thing had occurred (saying it again here: It\u2019s vanishingly rare) Barr asserted that \u201cwe indicted someone in Texas\u201d who had stolen 1,700 ballots. \u201cHe made them out and voted for the person he wanted to,\u201d he told Blitzer. That claim was also later confirmed as false.\n\nBut Barr just can\u2019t let his hatred of voting by mail go. As he fondly told the Tribune\u2019s John Kass, describing the way white people once voted\u2014mostly gathered from Norman Rockwell paintings, apparently\u2014\u201cJust think about the way we vote now. You have a precinct, your name is on a list, you go in and say who you are, you go behind a curtain, no one is allowed to go in there to influence you, and no one can tell how you voted. All of that is gone with mail-in voting.\u201d And when you vote by mail, he warned, \u201cThere\u2019s no secret vote. You have to associate the envelope in the mailing and the name of who\u2019s sending it in, with the ballot.\u201d These new new claims that voting by mail is somehow extra susceptible to fraud and also violative of voter privacy, autonomy, and secrecy have been debunked multiple times as well. But Barr\u2019s argument to Kass again has the desired effect of pitting voter against voter, American against American, in ways designed to foment doubt and mistrust in a system already stressed by U.S. Postal Service meddling and distortion and a steady drumbeat of presidential claims that\u2014as Trump suggested this week\u2014the only way he can possibly lose in Nevada is if its governor rigs the ballots. \u201cI\u2019m winning that state easily, but the one thing we can\u2019t beat, if they cheat on the ballots,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cNow he will cheat on the ballots\u2014I have no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nWhat Barr is actually performing here is the time-honored, Bannon-christened, Putin-sanctioned electoral practice known formally as flooding the zone with shit.\n\nBarr echoed these same talking points in his interview with Kass: \u201cSomeone will say the president just won Nevada. \u2018Oh, wait a minute! We just discovered 100,000 ballots! Every vote will be counted!\u2019 Yeah, but we don\u2019t know where these freaking votes came from.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know where these freaking votes came from\u201d is the new Lafayette Square.\n\nBarr, like Trump, is no longer content to blame foreigners and malign faceless vote tamperers. He also warned Kass that greedy mail carriers were apt to get in on the action: \u201cA secret vote prevents selling and buying votes. So now we\u2019re back in the business of selling and buying votes. Capricious distribution of ballots means (ballot) harvesting, undue influence, outright coercion, paying off a postman, here\u2019s a few hundred dollars, give me some of your ballots.\u201d Just to recap, then: Your mail-in ballot is unsafe because foreigners want to forge it, Democratic governors want to steal it, antifa operatives plan to harvest it, oh, and Dot, your friendly neighborhood letter carrier will also gladly break the law in order to sell it. This narrative need not be provable or coherent; it\u2019s enough that it\u2019s rinsed and repeated on a near-daily basis in the media.\n\nWhat Barr is actually performing here is the time-honored, Bannon-christened, Putin-sanctioned electoral practice known formally as flooding the zone with shit. What he wants most of all is for voters to doubt the capacity for the November election to be conducted fairly. That is why he told Blitzer that any effort to make voting safer in the midst of a pandemic\u2014and of course that\u2019s what the push for mail-in balloting was attempting to redress\u2014is by definition tantamount to \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d Under the pretense of concern for voter confidence, Barr jowlishly invents one reason after another to undermine it. \u201cWe\u2019re very closely divided country here, and people have to have confidence in the results of the election and the legitimacy of the government,\u201d Barr lectured Blitzer. \u201cAnd people trying to change the rules to this methodology, which as a matter of logic is very open to fraud and coercion, is reckless and dangerous, and the people are playing with fire.\u201d\n\nOne mentions the zone and the shit here only because, as Bloomberg News notes, \u201can intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security this month, first obtained by ABC News, said that Russian state media and proxy websites have sought to amplify criticisms of vote-by-mail to \u2018undermine public trust in the electoral process.\u2019 \u201d The bulletin added, \u201cWe assess that Russian state media, proxies, and Russian-controlled social media trolls are likely to promote allegations of corruption, system failure and foreign malign interference to sow distrust in democratic institutions and election outcomes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget, in the fog of daily outrages at DOJ, that a long-standing unwritten tradition once held that the department should do nothing in the 60 days before an election that might affect the outcome of that election. That in turn reflects a long-standing norm that the Justice Department actually wants elections, and democracy, to succeed. It\u2019s why\u2014right or wrong\u2014the Obama administration tried to downplay its concerns of foreign interference in 2016. But Barr isn\u2019t merely flouting that guidance with his unending fan dance around the October surprise that will come with the Durham report. He is fanning the flames of voter anxiety and doubt, under the guise of concern over voter anxiety and doubt.\n\nIn his sit-down with Kass, Barr made a stunning set of statements about \u201cliberals.\u201d But the most telling part came when he insisted: \u201cAll this bulls\u2014 about how the president is going to stay in office and seize power? I\u2019ve never heard of any of that crap. I mean, I\u2019m the attorney general. I would think I would have heard about it. They [\u201cliberals\u201d] are projecting. They are creating an incendiary situation where there will be loss of confidence in the vote.\u201d His very next warning was of fake ballots in Nevada stealing the election. When liberals worry about democracy, it\u2019s \u201cprojection.\u201d When he does it, well, it\u2019s transactional, which seems to make it OK.", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:09.335173", "publish_date": "2020-09-16", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-16 21:46:39.211000+00:00", "publish_time": "21:46:39", "source": "slate", "title": "Bill Barr would like to undermine your faith in the election.", "topics": ["election", "barr", "vote", "mailin", "foreign", "faith", "mail", "bill", "ballots", "voter", "undermine", "kass", "voting"]}
