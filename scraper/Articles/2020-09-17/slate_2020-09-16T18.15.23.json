{"authors": [], "body": "This month, Christina, Bryan, and Rumaan interview journalist Angela Chen about her new book, Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex. They talk about asexuality\u2019s rise in visibility, where ace people fit in the queer community, and how asexuality can lead us to question so many of our assumptions about social constructions that depend on who your sexual partners are. Then they unpack the story of gay politician Alex Morse, whose recent congressional campaign was plagued with accusations of sexual impropriety, and what a politician\u2019s queer sex life is allowed to look like.\n\nItems discussed on the show:\n\n\u2022 Clean House, hosted by Niecy Nash\n\n\u2022 Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex, by Angela Chen\n\n\u2022 \u201cMassachusetts Hopeful Alex Morse Couldn\u2019t Overcome Homophobic Smear,\u201d by Ryan Grim, Daniel Boguslaw, and Eoin Higgins in the Intercept\n\n\u2022 I Have Something to Tell You, by Chasten Buttigieg\n\n\u2022 \u201cFor Many Young Queer Women, Lesbian Offers a Fraught Inheritance,\u201d by Christina Cauterucci in Slate\n\nGay Agenda\n\nChristina: Ahead of the Curve\n\nRumaan: Great Demon Kings, by John Giorno\n\nBryan: Mapping the Gay Guides, and the Q&A with the creators by Madeline Ducharme in Slate.\n\nThis podcast was produced by Daniel Schroeder.\n\nPlease send feedback, topic ideas, and advice questions to outwardpodcast@slate.com.", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:10.188680", "publish_date": "2020-09-16", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-16 18:15:23.355000+00:00", "publish_time": "18:15:23", "source": "slate", "title": "Being Horny Is Thorny", "topics": ["horny", "sex", "reveals", "gay", "asexuality", "sexual", "ace", "thorny", "meaning", "queer", "society", "morse"]}
