{"authors": [], "body": "College application season is here and Aria, a 17 year-old senior, is stressing\u2014even more than usual. At her high school in Chicago\u2019s south suburbs, she gets good grades, is on the cheer team, in multiple honor societies, leads the choral ensemble, and hosts her own feminist podcast. But now that Aria\u2019s learning remotely during a pandemic, her anxiety is off the charts. How can she possibly choose a college, much less a career, amid such uncertainty? In this episode of How To!, we bring in Eve Ewing, a multi-talented poet, author, and sociologist, to help Aria work through her worries about the future. Like Aria, Eve spent time in Chicago-area public schools\u2014first as a student and then, to her own surprise, as a teacher. Eve knows you can\u2019t plan your exact path from Point A to Z. Instead, just focus on taking the next best step forward, Eve says, and trust that when you do, you\u2019ll be getting that much closer to the person you\u2019re destined to become.\n\nIf you liked this episode, check out \u201cHow To Perform Under Pressure.\u201d\n\nAre you worried about accomplishing your goals?
