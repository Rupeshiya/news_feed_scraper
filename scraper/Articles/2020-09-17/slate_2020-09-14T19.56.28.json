{"authors": ["Aaron Mak"], "body": "Last month, when President Donald Trump said he would ban the video app TikTok unless an American company took over its U.S. business, it was a solid bet that Microsoft would emerge as the buyer. Trump\u2019s stated concern was that TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based owner ByteDance could hand over user data to the Chinese government. Microsoft, the theory went, had the resources to take over the astronomically popular app but didn\u2019t already operate a major social network (sorry, LinkedIn). The president, however, reportedly expressed a different preference: Oracle, the database-software giant whose co-founder, Larry Ellison, is one of Trump\u2019s most prominent supporters in the technology industry.\n\nGuess what? It\u2019s Oracle. On Sunday night, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company made the winning bid, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Monday that his office had received the bid proposal over the weekend. The deal, notably, does not appear to involve an actual sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. Instead, Oracle would become TikTok\u2019s \u201ctrusted tech partner\u201d here. Many details surrounding the deal are still unclear, though it does seem to involve the hiring of a larger U.S. workforce. What\u2019s certainly clear is that while Oracle might seem like a strange fit\u2014its focus is enterprise and government clients, not lip-synching teens\u2014it has some of the closest ties with the Trump administration among major players in tech.\n\nThis relationship spans back to 2016, when company executives reportedly began hobnobbing with people in Trump\u2019s orbit right before the election. This ultimately resulted in Oracle CEO Safra Catz and chief lobbyist Ken Glueck joining the Trump administration\u2019s transition teams to devise plans around trade deals, the tax code, and government contracts. (Former senior executive George Polisner ended up resigning over the move, because he did not want to help the president in any way.)\n\nThe company\u2019s top brass have further aided Trump in his reelection bid. On Feb. 19, Trump held a fundraiser at Ellison\u2019s estate in Rancho Mirage, California, where attendees could pay $100,000 to play golf and take a photo with the president. Those who paid $250,000 could participate in a roundtable discussion with Trump. Oracle employees tried to pressure Ellison to call off the event and subsequently walked off the job when he went through with it anyway. Ellison defended himself by claiming that he was not present at the fundraiser, but nonetheless expressed his support for Trump. Catz has additionally donated more than $130,000 for Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Oracle goes both ways, including instances in which the White House sided with Oracle in disputes with other tech companies. Right now, Oracle is suing Google for infringing on its copyright for the Java programming language in a case that\u2019s currently before the Supreme Court. The solicitor general\u2019s office filed an amicus brief in support of Oracle in February, around the same time as the Trump fundraiser at Ellison\u2019s estate, calling Google\u2019s policy arguments \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d Oracle also sought to leverage its administration contacts in its campaign against Amazon\u2019s bid to win a Pentagon contract to build the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, which would be a centralized computing system for U.S. defense agencies. Glueck composed a document outlining an alleged conspiracy between Amazon and the Obama administration that eventually made it to Trump\u2019s desk. After Amazon lost the contract\u2014in fact, that bid went to Microsoft\u2014the e-commerce giant accused Trump of interfering with the bidding process.\n\nIn August, senior Labor Department lawyer Janet Herold alleged that she was facing retaliation after raising concerns about Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia\u2019s intervention in a pay discrimination case that employees had brought against Oracle. According to Herold, career staffers would usually handle this sort of case, but Scalia broke from normal protocols and pushed the department to seek a settlement of less than $40 million. Oracle was at risk of being on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay. The Labor Department denied any wrongdoing by Scalia, and Oracle contends that the suit was meritless.\n\nOracle has stuck with the administration throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and might even have played a role in Trump\u2019s baffling push to use hydroxychloroquine as a treatment despite little scientific evidence that it is effective. The New York Times reported that Trump first expressed interest in the drug in March, telling associates that he\u2019d been discussing it with Ellison. Oracle then donated a data platform to the administration so that officials could track how people were responding to the drug and other treatments. Ellison personally offered the technology for free in a call with Trump.\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s efforts to align itself with Trump undoubtedly boosted its bid for TikTok, there are other reasons the administration might see it as a good fit for the role. It\u2019s true that the company has a solid track record when it comes to data and cloud security, which in theory could help address the administration\u2019s concerns about protecting data on U.S. users. Yet the deal as currently structured may not actually do much to stop ByteDance from being able to indirectly siphon user data, since it doesn\u2019t seem like Oracle will control TikTok\u2019s source code. (The Chinese government reportedly stepped in to prevent ByteDance from selling TikTok\u2019s notoriously addictive algorithm as part of any deal.)\n\nIt\u2019s now up to the White House and the Treasury\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to review the deal\u2014and to decide, once again, whether to give one of the president\u2019s supporters exactly what it wants.", "current_date": "2020-09-17 18:14:12.772240", "publish_date": "2020-09-14", "publish_datetime": "2020-09-14 19:56:28.161000+00:00", "publish_time": "19:56:28", "source": "slate", "title": "How Oracle, now partnering with TikTok, became the Trump administration\u2019s favorite tech company.", "topics": ["trumps", "bid", "tech", "administrations", "administration", "ellison", "favorite", "company", "president", "oracle", "tiktok", "partnering", "trump", "tiktoks", "data"]}
